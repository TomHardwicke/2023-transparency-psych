This folder contains the R code used at various stages of the project. 

The main code that reproduces all results reported in the manuscript is available in analysis.qmd. Running this file (for example, in R Studio), will generate a HTML reproducible report that can be opened in a web browser.

Additionally, the code for the precision analysis is in precision_analysis.R and the code used to prepare the lists of articles is available in prepare-articles.R.

The main code (analysis.qmd) is also available in a Code Ocean container (https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.5081898.v1) packaged with the relevant software dependencies needed to successfully run the code.
