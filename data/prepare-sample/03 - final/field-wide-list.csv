Methods: Growth mixture modeling was used to identify trajectory curves in a sample of N = 210 outpatients diagnosed with PSS and treated either with conventional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or CBT enriched with emotion regulation training (ENCERT).
Results: We identified three subgroups of patients with similar symptom change patterns over the course of treatment (a ""no change,"" ""strong response,"" and ""slow change"" subgroup). Higher initial anxiety symptoms were significantly associated with the no change and strong response subgroups; symptom-related disability in daily routine with no changes. Patients with a strong response had the highest proportion of reliable improvement at termination and at six-month-follow-up.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that, instead of one common change pattern, patients with PSS respond differently to treatment. Due to the high association of symptom curves with long-term outcome, the identification and prediction of an individual's trajectory could provide important information for clinicians to identify non-responding patients that are at risk for failure.

Methods A Partial Credit Rasch Model was used to evaluate psychometric properties of the GQ-6 using a combined sample of 663 respondents from the USA (n = 345) and India (n = 318). Results Initial analysis showed significant scale dysfunction, with overall and individual item misfit, local dependency, disordered response thresholds, instances of differential item functioning by age and nationality, along with poor reliability. Through the use of recent advances in the Rasch methodology, locally dependent items were combined into two super-items and the best fit to the Rasch model was obtained with evidence of strict unidimensionality, invariance, and strong reliability. Results indicate the GQ-6 is suitable for individual and group assessment, while also permitting the creation of an ordinal-to-interval conversion algorithm which has been provided here. Conclusions This study confirmed the robust psychometric properties of the GQ-6 after minor modifications and provides a means for clinicians and researchers to improve the accuracy of this widely used measure in mindfulness research and other relevant studies without modification of its original response format.",DEC 2022,13,2022,2022-10-18,DEC,Journal,N,1868-8527,1868-8535,10.1007/s12671-022-02006-2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MINDFULNESS,Enhancing the Assessment of Gratitude in Mindfulness Research: a Rasch Analysis of the 6-Item Gratitude Questionnaire,MINDFULNESS,Mindfulness,MINDFULNESS,MINDFULNESS,1,publisher,SPRINGER,1,SPRINGER,MINDFULNESS

Beginning in March of 2020, the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) swiftly spread across the world, causing great tension and threat to peoples' lives. The present study examined whether and how rumination status (brooding and reflection) was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, from the perspectives of environmental stressors and perceived intrinsic stress. This study applied a cross-sectional design based on current and retrospective memories regarding participants' experiences of rumination, stress and anxiety. A total of 101 adults from the New York metropolitan area completed surveys that measure rumination, environmental stressors, perceived intrinsic stress, and anxiety symptoms based on their current experience during the cataclysmic event of COVID-19 and their recalled experience before the pandemic. Results indicated that changes in the environmental stressors significantly predicted changes in participants' engagement in reflection, but not in brooding, while changes in the levels of perceived intrinsic stress significantly predicted changes in brooding, but not in reflection. It was also found that rumination moderated the effects of external stressors on anxiety symptoms. Clinical interventions that reduce brooding activities and modify reflection activities could help individuals cope with the stress of a cataclysmic event in different ways.
Public Significance Statement Results of this COVID-19-focused study indicated that changes in environmental stressors significantly predicted changes in participants' reflection activity, but not in brooding, while changes in levels of perceived intrinsic stress significantly predicted changes in brooding, but not in reflection.

Vaccine boosters are essential for maintaining immunity and protecting against virus variants. The side effects of the primary COVID-19 vaccine (e.g., headache, nausea), however, could reduce intentions to repeat the vaccination experience, thereby hindering global inoculation efforts. Purpose The aim of this research was to test whether side effects of a primary COVID-19 vaccine relate to reduced intentions to receive a COVID-19 booster. The secondary aim was to test whether psychological and demographic factors predict booster intentions. Methods Secondary data analyses were conducted on a U.S. national sample of 551 individuals recruited through the online platform Prolific. Key measures in the dataset were side effects reported from a primary COVID-19 vaccination and subsequent intentions to receive a booster vaccine. Psychological and demographic variables that predicted primary vaccination intentions in prior studies were also measured. Results Booster intentions were high. COVID-19 booster vaccine intentions were uncorrelated with the number of side effects, intensity of side effects, or occurrence of an intense side effect from the primary COVID-19 vaccine. Correlational and regression analyses indicated intentions for a booster vaccination increased with positive vaccination attitudes, trust in vaccine development, worry about the COVID-19 pandemic, low concern over vaccine side effects, and democratic political party affiliation. Conclusions Side effects of a primary COVID-19 vaccine were not directly associated with lower intentions to receive a booster of the COVID-19 vaccine early in the pandemic.

Yet, there is limited evidence on the degree to which partial face occlusion is detrimental to empathic processes such as emotion perception and facial mimicry. To address this question, we conducted an online experiment (N=200, U.K. sample) that assessed subjective ratings and facial expressions (mimicry) in response to masked and unmasked faces. Perceivers were able to recognise happiness and sadness in dynamic emotion expressions independent of (surgical) face masks. However, perceived emotion intensity and interpersonal closeness were reduced for masked faces. Facial mimicry, the perceiver's imitation of the expresser's emotional display, was reduced or absent in response to happy but preserved for sad mask-covered expressions. For happy target expressions, the face-mimicry link was partially mediated by perceived emotion intensity, supporting the idea that mimicry is influenced by context effects. Thus, these findings suggest that whether face masks impede emotion communication depends on the emotion expressed and the emotion-communication aspect of interest.

In the last 50 years, influential fast-and-slow dual-process models that capitalize on this distinction have been used to account for numerous phenomena - from logical reasoning biases, over prosocial behavior, to moral decision making. The present paper clarifies that despite the popularity, critical assumptions are poorly conceived. My critique focuses on two interconnected foundational issues: the exclusivity and switch feature. The exclusivity feature refers to the tendency to conceive intuition and deliberation as generating unique responses such that one type of response is assumed to be beyond the capability of the fast-intuitive processing mode. I review the empirical evidence in key fields and show that there is no solid ground for such exclusivity. The switch feature concerns the mechanism by which a reasoner can decide to shift between more intuitive and deliberate processing. I present an overview of leading switch accounts and show that they are conceptually problematic - precisely because they presuppose exclusivity.

Results In those with ADHD, irritability was associated with atypical functional connectivity of both seed regions. Amygdala seeds showed greater connectivity with right inferior frontal gyrus and caudate/putamen, and less connectivity with precuneus. Nucleus accumbens seeds showed altered connectivity with middle temporal gyrus and precuneus. Conclusion The irritability-ADHD presentation is associated with atypical functional connectivity of reward and threat processing regions with cognitive control and emotion processing regions.

As a candidate starting analytic training in 2020, Freud's Mourning and Melancholia was particularly poignant as it lays the foundation for object relations borne out of a process of coping with loss. Freud described mourning as an agonizing process of identification, disinvestment and reinvestment. He emphasized the role of intrapsychic factors in the capacity to mourn. Since then, analysts have countered by writing about the highly social nature of the task of mourning and the importance in grieving of a loving communal embrace. In this paper, I explore one's early experiences with Winnicott's holding environment and transitional phenomena as an explanation of the capacity to mourn. I will extend mourning to another form of loss, namely, transience, i.e., temporariness of time and experience. Finally, I will consider how the developmental achievement of the capacity to be alone is inherent in specific intrapsychic modes of mourning transience and could be extended to intrapsychic capacity to mourn in bereavement.

Testing that hypothesis requires a normed measure of ambiguity, so that ambiguity and intensity can be manipulated independently. The standard deviation (SD) of intensity ratings has been used for that purpose, which has produced three characteristic ambiguity effects. Owing to the recency of such research, fundamental questions remain about the validity of this method of measuring ambiguity and about its process-level effects on memory. In a validity experiment, we found that the rating SDs of six semantic attributes (arousal, concreteness, familiarity, meaningfulness, negative valence, positive valence) passed tests of concurrent and predictive validity. In three memory experiments, we found that manipulating rating SDs had a specific effect on retrieval: It influenced subjects' ability to use reconstructive retrieval to recall words.

The illusory increase in perceived speed of the audio-visually synchronized object persisted when preventing eye movements. Using temporally matched color changes of the synchronized object also increased the perceived speed. Yet, using color changes of a surrounding frame instead of tones had no effect on perceived speed ruling out simple alertness explanations. Thus, in contrast to coinciding tones, visual coincidences only elicit illusory increases in perceived speed when the coincidence provided spatial information.

These findings suggest that viewers' involvement with different characters was related to a change in self-reported empathy toward others experiencing mental health issues. This work further highlights that narrative stories, even fictional stories without explicit educational goals, can create opportunities for viewers to connect, identify, and relate to characters, and this experience can shape how these viewers experience the world and intend to act toward others. This is particularly important for adolescents and young adults as their own identity and view of the world is being developed during this stage in their lives.
Previous research has considered if and how entertainment-education (EE) media consumption and connections with media characters relate to viewer attitudes and behavior. The literature, however, tends to consider viewer connections to 1 main character and samples from within the global region where the series is set. Thus, we build on this literature using survey data collected from adolescents and young adult viewers (N = 1,624) of the Netflix series, 13 Reasons Why, living in 4 regions around the world. We examine the relations between viewing, involvement with different main characters, story-consistent attitudes, and self-reported mental health-related behavior change. Results demonstrate differences in relationships between viewing and self-reported behavior as a function of viewers' favorite character, indicating that viewer connections to different media characters relates to self-reported outcomes.

Spatial construction abilities predict math and other academic outcomes and are regularly used in IQ testing, but we know little about the cognitive processes that underlie them. In part, this lack of understanding is due to both the complex nature of construction tasks and the tendency to limit measurement to the overall accuracy of the end goal. Using an automated recording and coding system, we examined in detail adults' performance on a block copying task, specifying their step-by-step actions, culminating in all steps in the full construction of the build-path. The results revealed the consistent use of a structured plan that unfolded in an organized way, layer by layer (bottom to top). We also observed that complete layers served as convergence points, where the most agreement among participants occurred, whereas the specific steps taken to achieve each of those layers diverged, or varied, both across and even within individuals. This pattern of convergence and divergence suggests that the layers themselves were serving as the common subgoals across both inter and intraindividual builds of the same model, reflecting cognitive ""chunking."" This structured use of layers as subgoals was functionally related to better performance among builders.

Social cognition training (SCT) is commonly used for improving social functioning, but lacks ecological validity and the ability to effectively mimic social situations. Development of virtual reality (VR) interventions, focusing on enhancing social cognition, could add to the effectiveness of SCT within ASD care, by offering a safe, interactive and practical training setting, where generalization of knowledge and skills to the real-world are promoted. In this paper, our primary aim is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptance by participants and therapists of the Dynamic Interactive Social Cognition Method: Training in Virtual Reality (DiSCoVR) protocol as developed for adults with schizophrenic spectrum disorder (SSD), adapted for ASD (DiSCoVR-A). 26 participants, aged 18-63, took part in a pilot study. 22 participants completed baseline and post-assessment, including primary outcome evaluation assessment through a semi-structured interview. Secondary measures focused on social cognition, emotion recognition, mental flexibility, social anxiety, empathy and social responsiveness and were assessed at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1), and at follow-up (T2) sixteen weeks after completion of the intervention. Results: Our results show that the majority of participant and therapists found the VR intervention acceptable and feasible, as reported in evaluation questionnaires and interviews.

The relative excess of GM may indicate putative compensatory responses, though to date its relevance is unclear. Methods 343 first-episode treatment-naive patients with schizophrenia (FES) and 342 HC were recruited. Multivariate source-based morphometry was performed to identify covarying 'networks' of grey matter concentration (GMC). Neurocognitive scores using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and symptom burden using the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) were obtained. Bivariate linear relationships between GMC and cognition/symptoms were studied. Results Compared to healthy subjects, FES had prominently lower GMC in two components; the first consists of the anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate and the second component with the superior temporal gyrus, precuneus, inferior/superior parietal lobule, cuneus, and lingual gyrus. Higher GMC was seen in adjacent areas of the middle and superior temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, inferior parietal cortex and putamen. Greater GMC of this component was associated with lower duration of untreated psychosis, less severe positive symptoms and better performance on cognitive tests. Conclusions In untreated stages of schizophrenia, both a distributed lower and higher GMC is observable. While the higher GMC is relatively modest, it occurs across frontoparietal, temporal and subcortical regions in association with reduced illness burden suggesting a compensatory role for higher GMC in the early stages of schizophrenia.",JUN 2023,53,2023,2022-02-15,JUN,Journal,N,0033-2917,1469-8978,10.1017/S0033291722000058,NA,MEDLINE:35164887,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,Ameliorative patterns of grey matter in patients with first-episode and treatment-naive schizophrenia,PSYCHOL MED,Psychol.

The current study combined low and high score base rates (BRs) for the Spanish-language NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB) to identify score combinations that are uncommon within different stratifications of the normative sample and may indicate cognitive impairment.
Method: The Spanish-language NIHTB-CB normative sample included 250 healthy Latinx adults with complete data on two crystallized and five fluid cognitive tests (M = 38.8 +/- 13.7 years old, 72.0% women). Test performances were converted into age-adjusted and demographically adjusted normed scores, adjusting for age, gender, and education. The frequencies at which participants obtained one or more low scores or few to no high scores on fluid cognitive tests were combined into algorithms that occurred at BRs approximately 1 SD (similar to 16%) or 1.5 SDs (similar to 7%) below the mean.
Results: Algorithms are provided for age-adjusted and demographically adjusted scores, with BRs stratified by crystallized ability, education, and sociocultural characteristics. Using demographically adjusted norms, the BR of obtaining any one of the following, 5 scores <50th, 4+ scores <= 25th, 3+ scores <= 16th, or 2+ scores <= 9th percentile, approximates 1 SD below the mean in participants born (BR = 16.2%) or educated abroad (BR = 18.6%), who are monolingual Spanish speakers (BR = 16.4%) or who reside in low-income households (BR = 13.6%).

The event-related potential (ERP) results of both experiments indicated that, in contrast to simple problems, hierarchical problems triggered enhanced N400 and late negative component (LNC), reflecting numerical fact retrieval, and generalizing novel hypotheses about the hidden rules by integrating adjacent numerical relations, respectively; relational integration showed similar N400 and LNC activation patterns to rule discovery (Experiment 1) or rule searching (Experiment 2).

To address this issue, we manipulated the probability of distractor occurrence at a fixed location, without varying the number of distractors being presented.

However, it is unknown if this pattern is similar depending on how much music training young people have received in their lifetime. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to examine four moderated mediation models in which music training (years of private lessons) may moderate how four maladaptive musical emotion regulation strategies (rumination, discharging negative emotions, avoidant coping, and liking sad music), respectively, mediate the relationship between neuroticism and internalizing symptoms (depression and anxiety). The sample comprised 647 university students aged between 17 and 21 years and ranging from not being a musician to having extensive music training. General (nonmusical) emotion regulation and coping strategies were statistically controlled to isolate potential effects inherent to music listening. Results indicated that liking sad music mediated the link between neuroticism and internalizing symptoms but that this mediation effect was not significant in music listeners who had cumulated more music training throughout their life. In this case, perhaps extensive music training was a protective factor against maladaptive musical emotion regulation. Nevertheless, across a variety of musicianship characteristics, musical emotion regulation strategies showed more similarities than differences between musicians and nonmusicians. In sum, among four musical emotion regulation mechanisms, liking sad music might be a more consistent emotional pathway from neuroticism to internalizing symptoms in young music listeners with less music training.",NA,NA,2022,2022-05-12,MAY 12,Journal,N,1931-3896,1931-390X,10.1037/aca0000486,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGY OF AESTHETICS CREATIVITY AND THE ARTS,"Neuroticism, Musical Emotion Regulation, Musical Coping, Mental Health, and Musicianship Characteristics",PSYCHOL AESTHET CREA,Psychol.

In the present study, we examined whether social relationships can buffer potential negative effects of spousal loss on cognition. We examined the role of social network, social activities, and perceived deficiencies in social relationships (loneliness). Method We used longitudinal data between 1998 and 2012 from 2,074 participants of the Health and Retirement Study, who had experienced spousal loss during the study period. Multilevel modeling was used to examine how time-varying indicators of social network, social activities, and loneliness were related to age-related trajectories of episodic memory prior to and after spousal loss. Analyses controlled for gender, race/ethnicity, education, time-varying functional health, and being repartnered/remarried. Results Having children living within 10 miles and providing help to others buffered negative effects of widowhood on episodic memory. In addition, within-person increase in providing help to others buffered against decline in episodic memory after spousal loss. Having friends in the neighborhood, more frequent social visits, providing help to others, volunteering, and lack of loneliness were related to higher episodic memory, while having relatives in the neighborhood was related to lower episodic memory.

Men owning shirts with larger luxury brand logos were rated higher on mating effort, lower on parental investment, higher on interest in brief sexual affairs, lower on interest in long-term committed romantic relationships, higher in attractiveness to women for brief sexual affairs, lower in attractiveness to women for long-term committed relationships, and higher in developmental environment unpredictability compared with men owning shirts displaying a smaller logo. Participants recognized the strategic use of luxury display properties across social contexts but did not consistently associate product properties with owners' physiological characteristics.",MAR 2022,48,2022,2021-04-15,MAR,Journal,N,0146-1672,1552-7433,10.1177/01461672211007229,NA,MEDLINE:33858239,NA,NA,NA,PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY BULLETIN,Phenotypic Mimicry Distinguishes Cues of Mating Competition From Paternal Investment in Men's Conspicuous Consumption,PERS SOC PSYCHOL B,Pers.

We investigate the association between nativity status, age of migration, and cognitive life expectancies among a nationally representative sample of Latino adults aged 50 and older to explore whether age of migration and gender influence cognitive aging across the life course. Methods This study used data from the Health and Retirement Study (1998-2016) to estimate Sullivan-based life tables of cognitive life expectancies by nativity, age of migration, and gender for older Latino adults. Cognitive status was based on the Langa-Weir algorithm. We test for both within-group (i.e., nativity and age of migration) and gender differences to explore the overall burden of disease among this rapidly growing population. Results Foreign-born Latinos, regardless of age of migration or gender, spend a greater number of years after age 50 with cognitive impairment/no dementia than U.S.-born Latinos. However, the number of years spent with dementia varied by subgroup with midlife immigrant men and late-life immigrant men and women exhibiting a significant disadvantage relative to the U.S.-born. Furthermore, we document a gender disadvantage for all Latino women, regardless of immigrant status. Discussion The robust relationship between nativity, age of migration, and cognitive aging suggests that older foreign-born Latinos experiencing cognitive decline may place serious burdens on families.

I argue that among the psychological roots of this lack of confidence there is a kind of intuitive thinking that can be traced back to a specific superstitious belief: the belief that ""it is bad luck to tempt fate"". Under certain conditions, subjects perceive the choice to undergo vaccinations as an action that ""tempts fate"", and this leads them to overestimate its risks. When an action is perceived as ""tempting fate"", indeed, its possible negative outcomes are anticipated as highly aversive, and as such they capture subjects' imagination, thereby feeling more subjectively probable. This has important consequences for practical pro-vaccine interventions. Part of what makes an action perceived as ""tempting fate"" is its being free, arbitrary, and departing from one's typical behavior: insofar as vaccine hesitancy is driven by beliefs about tempting fate, then, we can predict the success of interventions that make vaccinations nearly mandatory, or build vaccination opportunities into health care routines as opt-out, rather than opt-in options, making them closer to something that subjects passively accept rather actively seek.",AUG 18 2023,36,2023,2022-07-07,AUG 18,Journal,N,0951-5089,1465-394X,10.1080/09515089.2022.2096432,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY,"Vaccine hesitancy and the reluctance to ""tempt fate""",PHILOS PSYCHOL,Philos.

In the present study, we provide evidence that speed-accuracy tradeoffs (SATs) can have opposing effects on performance across two different conflict tasks. Specifically, in a single preregistered experiment, the mean reaction time (RT) congruency effect in the Simon task increased, whereas the mean RT congruency effect in the Eriksen task decreased, when the focus was put on response speed versus accuracy. Critically, distributional RT analyses revealed distinct delta plot patterns across tasks, thus indicating that the unfolding of distractor-based response activation in time is sufficient to explain the opposing pattern of congruency effects. In addition, a recent evidence accumulation model with the notion of time-varying conflicting information was successfully fitted to the experimental data. These fits revealed task-specific time-courses of distractor-based activation and suggested that time pressure substantially decreases decision boundaries in addition to reducing the duration of non-decision processes and the rate of evidence accumulation. Overall, the present results suggest that time pressure can have multiple effects in decision-making under conflict, but that strategic adjustments of decision boundaries in conjunction with different time-courses of distractor-based activation can produce counteracting effects on task performance with different types of distracting sources of information.",JUN 2022,29,2022,2021-12-16,JUN,Journal,N,1069-9384,1531-5320,10.3758/s13423-021-02003-x,NA,MEDLINE:34918279,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW,The time-course of distractor-based activation modulates effects of speed-accuracy tradeoffs in conflict tasks,PSYCHON B REV,Psychon.

However, there is a paucity of literature evaluating the use of combinatorial pharmacogenetics panels to enhance outcomes in the treatment of adolescents with depression. This study sought to prospectively evaluate the clinical impact of combinatorial pharmacogenetics testing in a double-blind, randomized, controlled effectiveness study for the pharmacologic treatment of adolescents with depression. Method: Adolescents aged 13 to 18 years (N = 176) with moderate to severe major depressive disorder (MDD) were randomized to treatment arm guided by testing in which pharmacogenetic testing results were available at the baseline visit (GENE arm, n = 84) or a treatment-as-usual arm (TAU arm, n = 92) in which testing results were not available until an 8-week visit. Raters, participants, and families were blinded to group allocation. Symptom improvement, side effects, and satisfaction were assessed throughout the study at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 6 months. Results: There were no differences between the GENE and TAU arms at 8 weeks or 6 months for symptom improvement, side effect burden, or satisfaction. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were prescribed at higher rates in the TAU arm compared to the GENE arm (p = .024). Conclusion: Combinatorial pharmacogenetics-guided treatment did not demonstrate improved outcomes compared to TAU in adolescents with MDD. Future research should examine how specific medication-gene pairs may affect clinical outcomes in the treatment of adolescents with depression and how best to integrate pharmacogenetics into clinical practice.

Initial evidence for healthy participants suggests that this might be due to group membership providing a sense of personal control. In this research, we investigate this pathway for chronically ill patients, assuming that any ingroup (even patient identity) can serve as social cure by increasing control as long as the ingroup is perceived as agentic (i.e., effective). Design We conducted six correlational field studies with patients suffering from different chronic conditions, e.g., cancer (N-total = 795). Methods All participants were asked about one specific ingroup, e.g., their self-help group. Our main measures were ingroup identification, ingroup agency, personal control and well-being, as well as self-esteem and social support (both discussed as alternative mediators). We performed simple mediation and/or moderated mediation analyses for each study and across studies (merging Studies 2-6). Results Overall, the impact of ingroup identification on personal well-being was uniquely mediated via personal control (Studies 1, 2, 3, 6) but, as expected, only for those perceiving their ingroup as highly agentic (Studies 4, 5, 6).

Furthermore, the secondary purpose is to examine the function of environmental uncertainty moderating the DCs-performance relationship. Concerning the analysis tool, this study employs topic modeling with Word2Vec embedding that analyzes unstructured data. This was employed as an alternative method beyond the limitations of the traditional approach, i.e., survey or interview. A DCs dictionary was constructed by redesigning the 12 detailed dimensions of Teece's DCs into 10 dimensions, and then time series scores of individual global companies were extracted by applying this dictionary to the sustainability reports of 97 companies. Sustainability reports of 153 companies among Fortune Global 500 companies announced in 2020 were originally collected, but in the process of collecting additional financial data about these companies from OSIRIS, a total of only 97 companies was selected in the end due to omission of data. A fixed effect panel analysis was conducted, and the main findings are as follows: First, the DCs embedded in ESG management have a positive or negative direct effect on corporate performance. In particular, a statistically significant relationship was not observed in the innovation (technology) oriented capabilities, whereas a statistically significant positive relationship was observed in the customer (market) oriented capabilities. Second, uncertainty moderates the relationship between DCs and corporate performance positively or negatively. Interestingly, the moderating effect of uncertainty only appears in the function of the sensing and reconfiguring capabilities. From this, it can be seen that the function of DCs, which is embedded in the ESG management of global companies, is limited due to the imbalance between the sensing-seizing-reconfiguring capabilities. These findings imply that, despite the positive function of DCs embedded in ESG management, costs and benefits occur at the same time, and DCs can improve performance only if there is an organizational adaptation strategy suitable for uncertainty. Accordingly, business managers need to recognize the importance of pursuing sensing-seizing-reconfiguring capabilities in a balanced way to improve corporate performance through ESG management under uncertainty.",MAY 11 2022,13,2022,2022-05-11,MAY 11,Journal,Y,1664-1078,NA,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.898935,NA,MEDLINE:35645900,NA,NA,NA,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,Assessing the Effect of Dynamic Capabilities on the ESG Reporting and Corporate Performance Relationship With Topic Modeling: Evidence From Global Companies,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

The present study used an eye-gaze task to evaluate predictive language processing among 3- to 4-year-old autistic children (n = 34) and 1.5- to 3-year-old, language-matched neurotypical (NT) children (n = 34). Children viewed images (e.g., a cake and a ball) and heard sentences with informative verbs (e.g., Eat the cake) or neutral verbs (e.g., Find the cake). Analyses of children's looking behaviors indicated that young autistic children, like their language-matched NT peers, engaged in predictive language processing. Regression results revealed a significant effect of diagnostic group, when statistically controlling for age differences. The NT group displayed larger difference scores between the informative and neutral verb conditions (in looks to target nouns) compared to the ASD group. Receptive language measures were predictive of looking behavior across time for both groups, such that children with stronger language skills were more efficient in making use of informative verbs to process upcoming information.

However, we question whether the compartmentalization-adjustment association is null for everyone, and specifically, whether high compartmentalization (i.e., low blendedness) is ever good for adjustment. To examine the boundary conditions of these previous findings, we proposed that dialectical thinking (or the tolerance for psychological contradictions) is a potential moderator of the compartmentalization-adjustment association. With data from 795 self-identified bicultural/multicultural individuals from a large U.S.-American university, we found a significant moderating effect of dialectical thinking on the compartmentalization-adjustment association, such that the null relationship between compartmentalization and adjustment was evident for only biculturals with low levels of dialectical thinking. Interestingly, for biculturals with high levels of dialectical thinking, compartmentalization significantly predicted higher psychological adjustment. In other words, for biculturals who tend to think dialectically, perceiving their cultural identities as more compartmentalized was linked to better psychological adjustment. These findings suggest that the association between compartmentalization and adjustment may depend on moderating factors, such as dialectical thinking. We discuss further theoretical implications and future possibilities in biculturalism research.",SEP 2022,90,2022,2022-09-01,SEP,Journal,N,0147-1767,1873-7552,10.1016/j.ijintrel.2022.07.002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS,Different but not at odds: Dialectical thinking moderates the association between bicultural compartmentalization and adjustment,INT J INTERCULT REL,Int.

Attention has typically been studied in terms of what it is directed toward, but it can also be associated with a localized representation in the body image that is experienced as the source or seat of attention-an aspect that has previously only been studied by subjective techniques. Published studies of this phenomenon under terms such as egocenter or self-location suggest that the seat of attention can be situated in various ways within the experienced body, resulting in what are here referred to as different attentional stances. These studies also provide evidence that changes in attentional stance are associated with differences in cognitive skill, emotional temperament, self-construal, and social and moral attitudes, as well as with access to certain states of consciousness. In the present study, EEG results from multiple trials of each of 11 specific attentional stances confirmed that patterns of neural activity associated with the voluntarily control of attentional stances can be reliably measured, providing evidence for a differential neural substrate underlying the subjective location of the seat of attention. Additionally, brain activation patterns for the attentional stances showed strong correlations with EEG signatures associated with specific positive emotional states and with arousal, confirming that differential locations of the seat of attention can be objectively associated with different emotion states, as implied in previous literature.

This study employed virtual reality to investigate the effects of facade geometry and daylight patterns on space impressions and physiological responses (skin conductance, heart rate, and heart rate variability), while simultaneously examining the effect of sky type, spatial context, and latitude on participant responses. In an experimental study conducted in Switzerland and Greece, 256 participants were exposed to immersive interior scenes with six facade geometry variations with the same perforation ratio, derived from contemporary architecture. Participants evaluated the scenes under different sky types (clear sky with high or low sun angle, or overcast sky) and spatial contexts (working or socializing). The facade geometry influenced both the appraisal (how pleasant, interesting, exciting, or calming the space was perceived) and the visual appearance of the space (how complex, bright, or spacious the space was perceived). Facade geometry also influenced the reported satisfaction with the amount of view, with a facade variation with small, irregularly distributed openings driving this effect. Neither the sky type nor the spatial context influenced space impressions. Results showed a significant effect of country and an interaction between country and facade geometry only for ratings of excitement, with participants in Greece rating specific facade variations as more exciting than participants in Switzerland. Skin conductance level (log Delta SCL) decreased under exposure to a social context in clear sky with a low sun angle compared to a working context in overcast sky conditions. No significant effects were found for the other physiological measures. The results of the present study show that facade geometry was the main driver of the participants' spatial experience, inducing perceptual effects that were robust to variations in sky type and space function and to regional differences (except for excitement).

Independent strands of research further suggest that this association depends on concentration and a guilty-dysphoric daydreaming style. However, it remains unclear whether this association is specific to particular features of executive functioning or certain operationalizations of mind wandering, including task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs, comprising external distractions and mind wandering) and stimulus-independent and task-unrelated thoughts (SITUTs, comprising mind wandering only). This study sought to clarify these associations by using confirmatory factor analysis to compute latent scores for distinct executive functions based on nine cognitive tasks and relating them to experience sampling reports of mind wandering. We expected that individuals with greater executive control (specifically updating) would show a stronger reduction in SITUTs as momentary concentration and guilty-dysphoric style increase. A bifactor model of the cognitive battery indicated a general factor (common executive functioning) and ancillary factors (updating and shifting). A significant interaction between updating and concentration on mind wandering was observed with mind wandering defined as TUTs, but not as SITUTs (N = 187). A post hoc analysis clarified this discrepancy by showing that as concentration increases, both external distractions and mind wandering decrease more strongly among people with greater updating. Moreover, common executive functioning predicted a more negative slope of guilty-dysphoric style on SITUTs, whereas updating and shifting predicted more positive slopes. The opposite slopes of these executive functions on daily life mind wandering may reflect a stability-flexibility trade-off between goal maintenance and goal replacement abilities.",APR 25 2022,7,2022,2022-04-25,APR 25,Journal,Y,2365-7464,NA,10.1186/s41235-022-00383-9,NA,MEDLINE:35467232,NA,NA,NA,COGNITIVE RESEARCH-PRINCIPLES AND IMPLICATIONS,The contribution of latent factors of executive functioning to mind wandering: an experience sampling study,COGN RES,Cogn.

However, the extent to which methamphetamine involvement in deaths differs from those changes occurring in synthetic opioid involvement is unknown. Objectives To determine the patterns and temporal changes in methamphetamine-related deaths with and without other drug involvement. Methods Data from all methamphetamine-related deaths in West Virginia from 2013 to 2018 were analyzed. Quasi-Poisson regression analyses over time were conducted to compare the rates of change in death counts among methamphetamine and fentanyl//FA subgroups. Results A total of 815 methamphetamine-related deaths were analyzed; 572 (70.2%) were male and 527 (64.7%) involved an opioid. The proportion of methamphetamine only deaths stayed relatively flat over time although the actual numbers of deaths increased. Combined fentanyl/FAs and methamphetamine were involved in 337 deaths (41.3%) and constituted the largest increase from 2013 to 2018. The modeling of monthly death counts in 2017-2018 found that the average number of deaths involving fentanyl without methamphetamine significantly declined (rate of change -0.025, p < .001), while concomitant fentanyl with methamphetamine and methamphetamine only death counts increased significantly (rate of change 0.056 and 0.057, respectively, p < .001). Conclusions Fentanyl and FAs played an increasingly significant role in methamphetamine-related deaths. The accelerating number of deaths involving fentanyl/FAs and methamphetamine indicates the importance of stimulants and opioids in unintentional deaths.

The purpose of the present paper is to better understand the reactions of recruiters when they are offered algorithm-based recommendations during resume screening. Two polarized attitudes have been identified in the literature on users' reactions to algorithm-based recommendations: algorithm aversion, which reflects a general distrust and preference for human recommendations; and automation bias, which corresponds to an overconfidence in the decisions or recommendations made by algorithmic decision support systems (ADSS). Drawing on results obtained in the field of automated decision support areas, we make the general hypothesis that recruiters trust human experts more than ADSS, because they distrust algorithms for subjective decisions such as recruitment. An experiment on resume screening was conducted on a sample of professionals (N = 694) involved in the screening of job applications. They were asked to study a job offer, then evaluate two fictitious resumes in a 2 x 2 factorial design with manipulation of the type of recommendation (no recommendation/algorithmic recommendation/human expert recommendation) and of the consistency of the recommendations (consistent vs. inconsistent recommendation). Our results support the general hypothesis of preference for human recommendations: recruiters exhibit a higher level of trust toward human expert recommendations compared with algorithmic recommendations. However, we also found that recommendation's consistence has a differential and unexpected impact on decisions: in the presence of an inconsistent algorithmic recommendation, recruiters favored the unsuitable over the suitable resume. Our results also show that specific personality traits (extraversion, neuroticism, and self-confidence) are associated with a differential use of algorithmic recommendations.

We recorded the EEG signal of twenty deaf and twenty hearing readers while they performed a lexical decision task.

Despite hearing readers having higher phonological abilities, results showed a remarkably similar time course of the lexicality effect in deaf and hearing readers.

This study aimed to examine the role of three stress appraisals of the COVID-19 pandemic - threat appraisal, harm/loss appraisal, and challenge appraisal - and the interaction between these appraisals and intolerance of uncertainty (IU) on psychological distress and QoL. Design This was a cross-sectional survey study using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Methods A sample of 327 adults living in the U.S. completed a series of questionnaires investigating IU, appraisal of the pandemic, psychological distress, and QoL in May 2020 during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Controlling for demographic variables, IU and harm/loss appraisal positively related to psychological distress and negatively related to QoL. Challenge appraisals negatively related to distress and positively related to QoL.

This observation is partly due to characteristics of our samples that are associated with lower risk for gambling-related harm, but might also be due to overly high risk thresholds or flaws in the design of some markers. Users with higher average risk scores had more intraindividual variability in risk scores. Younger age and male gender were not associated with higher average risk scores.

Multiple clinicians have developed practice-based models of couple healing from infidelity; however, few of these models have been systematically examined. One such model is Butler et al.'s clinical model, grounded in attachment theory and the concept of relational ambivalence. In the present study, we sought to systematically examine and refine Butler et al.'s model of couple healing from infidelity using deductive qualitative analysis of seven publicly available online blogs written by non-straying partners. Informed by the clinically based model, we generated sensitizing constructs and engaged in open, focused, and theoretical coding. Our results support several key components of the original model, while also suggesting refinements to the concept of ambivalence for straying partners as well as couple-level responses. Our results suggest that a meaningful expansion to the original model is non-straying partners' efforts to heal individually throughout the entire healing process. We suggest clinical implications and opportunities for future research based on our analysis.

As facial affect is a fundamental way that individuals communicate their emotional state, studies have examined differences in how Black and White threatening facial expressions are perceived. However, perceptual decisions regarding threatening and neutral stimuli often occur in familiar contexts or in environments where explicit cues indicate the presence or absence of threat. Furthermore, these decisions often occur in ""noisy"" (i.e., ambiguous) environments where the quality of sensory evidence is poor, requiring us to rely on perceptual ""sets"" or expectations to interpret such evidence. Therefore, in the present study we used a two-alternative perceptual decision-making task in which participants used threatening and neutral cue-elicited perceptual sets to discriminate between subsequently presented threatening and neutral Black and White faces. Threatening cues led to a greater tendency to decide that both Black and White faces were threatening, as well as faster and greater discriminability between threatening and neutral Black and White faces. However, race-related differences revealed that, following both cue types, discriminability between threatening and neutral Black faces was worse compared to White faces. Therefore, using a paradigm that is ecologically valid, our findings highlight the importance of examining basic aspects of visual perception to understand race-related differences in threat-related perceptual decision-making.

This study draws on a unique linkage between the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and state voter files to characterize voting trajectories in later life and explore their determinants. Methods Using sequence analysis, we identify 5 voting typologies based on turnout and voting methods over 8 biennial elections. Using multinomial logistic and Poisson regressions, we examine the role of physical, cognitive, and mental health and wealth in shaping enfranchisement and civic participation at older ages. Results Health and wealth are both positively associated with voter turnout, but the negative impact of poor health on voting declines with increasing wealth. Voting at the polls and early voting are more common among healthier older adults, whereas absentee voting is more common among older voters who are more affluent, less healthy, or both. Among those less wealthy, absentee methods mitigate the impact of poor health for previously active voters, but do not compensate for a lower turnout rate. In addition to physical and cognitive limitations, emotional difficulties and depression reduce turnout, particularly among the least wealthy.

The present study investigated how tone and intonation, with F0 encodings in conflict or in congruency, are processed and how semantic context may affect their processing. To this end, tone and intonation identification experiments were conducted in both semantically neutral and constraining contexts. Results showed that the overall performance of tone identification was better than that of intonation. Specifically, tone identification was seldom affected by intonation information irrespective of semantic contexts. However, intonation identification, particularly question intonation, was susceptible to the final lexical tone identity and affected by the semantic context. In the semantically neutral context, questions ending with a rising tone and a falling tone were equally difficult to identify. In the semantically constraining context, questions ending with a falling tone were much better identified than those ending with a rising tone.

Despite the personal and professional challenges, they contributed immensely during the pandemic. However, there were variations in nurses' work engagement during the pandemic. One reason could be their personality, especially neuroticism. Neuroticism represents individuals' proneness to distress in stressful situations, such as COVID-19. Hence, understanding how and in which conditions neuroticism influences work engagement is crucial. We used the Job Demand-Resource (JD-R) model to test the association between neuroticism and work engagement. As neuroticism represents the stress-proneness of an individual, we further investigated if stress mediates the neuroticism-work engagement link. For the nurses, patient interaction is an integral part of their job. Based on the data collected from the nurses, we tested if contact with patients (i.e., beneficiary contact) alleviates the adverse effect of neuroticism on work engagement. During COVID-19, there was an intense need for nursing support. Hence, avoiding duty when society is looking for support might induce a fear of stigmatization among the nurses. We examined if the perceived stigma of duty avoidance would affect the neuroticism-engagement relationship. Our results indicated that higher patient contact alleviated the adverse effect of neuroticism on work engagement. On the other hand, higher fear of stigma exacerbated the adverse effect of neuroticism on work engagement. We further checked the combined effect of beneficiary contact and fear of stigma on neuroticism-work engagement relationships.

The paper reveals multidimensional nature of organizational culture. The findings show that all the dimensions are influencing corporate culture. It is important to note that organizational culture is a complex and multifaceted concept, and it can be challenging to fully understand and analyze the cultural dimensions of a company. Limited time and information can make it difficult to fully explore the cultural dimensions of an organization. However, understanding the cultural dimensions of a company can be important for a number of reasons. As a conclusion the dimensions have a positive impact on the corporate performance where the companies are growing and globalizing. Moreover, the analysis shows cultural differences at organizational level in terms of firm type, size, and age.

Participants of 60 undergraduate students with a mean age of 20.23 years were randomly assigned into experimental and control groups.

Immediately after the conclusion of the physical task, they performed the divided attention test on the Vienna Test System, during which participants of the experimental group were instructed to use strategic intructional self-talk cues. The analysis of the final assessment showed that the self-talk group had a higher percentage of correct responses and faster reaction times than the control group. The results of this study suggest that strategic instructional self-talk can help counter the potentially negative consequences of physical exhaustion on attention.

Results Within each subsample, new onset was reported by: 21% for binge eating, 10.8% for low weight, 23.5% for suicidal and/or self-harm ideation, and 3.5% for self-harm. Shared risk factors included having a lifetime psychiatric disorder, not being in paid employment, higher pandemic worry scores, and being racially minoritized. Conversely, infection with SARS-CoV-2/illness with COVID-19 was linked to lower odds of binge eating, low weight, and suicidal and/or self-harm ideation. Discussion Overall, we detected shared risk factors that may drive the comorbidity between eating disorders and self-harm. Subgroups of individuals with these risk factors may require more frequent monitoring during future pandemics. Public Significance In a sample of 35,000 UK residents, people who had a psychiatric disorder, identified as being part of a racially minoritized group, were not in paid employment, or were more worried about the pandemic were more likely to experience binge eating, low weight, suicidal and/or self-harm ideation, and self-harm for the first time during the pandemic. People with these risk factors may need particular attention during future pandemics to enable early identification of new psychiatric symptoms.",JAN 2023,56,2023,2022-10-31,JAN,Journal,N,0276-3478,1098-108X,10.1002/eat.23834,NA,MEDLINE:36315390,NA,NA,NA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS,"Risk and protective factors for new-onset binge eating, low weight, and self-harm symptoms in >35,000 individuals in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic",INT J EAT DISORDER,Int.

Chinese undergraduate students were more prepared in resource management, motivation, and help seeking, but less prepared in learning strategies, information technology skills, and self-efficacy.

While increasing attention has been given to drug-related harm among youth, little is known about how social-structural conditions influence their risk of fentanyl exposure. Therefore, we evaluated potential relationships between social-structural conditions and fentanyl exposure among youth who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, BC. Methods: Data were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort study. The ARYS cohort involves street-involved youth, who use illicit substances in Vancouver, Canada. A multivariable logic regression analysis model was used to identify social factors associated with recent fentanyl exposure as determined through urine drug screening. Results: Overall, 423 participants were included in this analysis, with 380 (38.23%) testing positive for recent fentanyl exposure. In a multivariable relative risk analysis, living in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside in the last six months (RR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.03-1.32) and daily heroin injection drug use (RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.15 - 1.50) were positively associated with fentanyl exposure. As a secondary measure, we found that within the encounters who denied using fentanyl (92.25% of total encounters), 321 (35.05%) still tested positive. Conclusions: We found that youth residing in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside was positively associated with being exposed to fentanyl.

This paper proposes a Bayesian estimation approach based on the device of data augmentation that addresses the handling of missing values in multilevel latent regression models. Population heterogeneity is modeled via multiple groups enriched with random intercepts. Bayesian estimation is implemented in terms of a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling approach. To handle missing values, the sampling scheme is augmented to incorporate sampling from the full conditional distributions of missing values. We suggest to model the full conditional distributions of missing values in terms of non-parametric classification and regression trees. This offers the possibility to consider information from latent quantities functioning as sufficient statistics. A simulation study reveals that this Bayesian approach provides valid inference and outperforms complete cases analysis and multiple imputation in terms of statistical efficiency and computation time involved.

The current article leverages the historical challenges faced by female ancestors to understand modern women's same-sex relationships. Across history, women were largely denied independent access to resources, often depending on male partners' provisioning to support themselves and their children. Same-sex peers thus became women's primary romantic rivals in competing to attract and retain relationships with the limited partners able and willing to invest. Modern women show signs of this competition, disliking and aggressing against those who threaten their romantic prospects, targeting especially physically attractive and sexually uninhibited peers. However, women also rely on one another for aid, information, and support. As most social groups were patrilocal across history, upon marriage, women left their families to reside with their husbands. Female ancestors likely used reciprocal altruism or mutualism to facilitate cooperative relationships with nearby unrelated women. To sustain these mutually beneficial cooperative exchange relationships, women may avoid competitive and status-striving peers, instead preferring kind, humble, and loyal allies. Ancestral women who managed to simultaneously compete for romantic partners while forming cooperative female friendships would have been especially successful. Women may therefore have developed strategies to achieve both competitive and cooperative goals, such as guising their intrasexual competition as prosociality or vulnerability. These historical challenges make sense of the seemingly paradoxical pattern of female aversion to competition, relational aggression, and valuation of loyal friends, offering insight into possible opportunities for intervention.",OCT 2022,51,2022,2021-01-04,OCT,Journal,N,0004-0002,1573-2800,10.1007/s10508-020-01768-x,NA,MEDLINE:33398709,NA,NA,NA,ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR,Our Grandmothers' Legacy: Challenges Faced by Female Ancestors Leave Traces in Modern Women's Same-Sex Relationships,ARCH SEX BEHAV,Arch.

However, despite how chronic and central transnationalism is to the lives of ULIs, little is known about its relation to the health outcomes of ULIs. To that end, this study examined the relation between distress due to transnational family separation and the physical and mental health of ULIs. To do so, the study utilized respondent-driven sampling and path analysis methodologies to cross-sectionally examine how distress from transnational separation was related to the physical and mental health of ULIs (n = 229). Results revealed that as distress from transnational family separation increased so too did participant's depressive (beta = .25, p < .001), anxiety (beta = .18, p = .006), and physical symptoms (beta = .24, p < .0001). Distress from transnational family separation was also more strongly related to physical and depressive symptoms than to anxiety symptoms.

Across three studies (N = 1317), we find that biogeographic information impacts racial categorization and beliefs about both genetic racial essentialism (i.e., the extent to which people believe that race is genetically derived) and biological race differences. Specifically, we find people are more likely to categorize Black/White biracial targets as Black and believe that a target is more biologically different from White people (e.g., has thicker skin) as the target's percent sub-Saharan African biogeographic ancestry (ABGA) increases (Studies 1 and 2). We also find that people misrepresent BGA as ""race genes,"" such that they perceive Black/White biracial targets with more ABGA as sharing more genes with Black people, which then predicts greater Black racial categorization of the target and increased beliefs that the target is susceptible to certain physical and mental illnesses (Study 2). Notably, BGA remains a predictor of these outcomes even when people know the target's specific racial ancestry, that is, their exact number of Black grandparents (Study 2). Finally, we find that exposing people to the idea that race is genetically derived, compared to biologically derived, exaggerates beliefs that genes determine both human life (genetic essentialism) and racial categories (genetic racial essentialism; Study 3).

We investigated eight captive Canada jays' (Perisoreus canadensis) ability to both identify and exploit conifer tree species. Further, we examined potential cues that birds may use to identify and select these potentially beneficial sites. We found strong evidence to suggest that birds can quickly identify conifer tree species and subsequently exploit those cache locations preferentially. Furthermore, our evidence suggests that although birds do not appear to use olfactory cues when making caching decisions, they potentially to attend to structural cues.

Recent studies on abstract concepts emphasizing the role of language have argued that abstract concepts are grounded indirectly in perceptual experiences and language (or words) functions as a bridge between abstract concepts and perceptual experiences. However, this ""indirect grounding"" view remains largely speculative and has hardly been supported directly by empirical evidence. In this paper, therefore, we test the indirect grounding view by means of multimodal distributional semantics, in which the meaning of a word (i.e., a concept) is represented as the combination of textual and visual vectors. The newly devised multimodal distributional semantic model incorporates the indirect grounding view by computing the visual vector of an abstract word through the visual vectors of concrete words semantically related to that abstract word. An evaluation experiment is conducted in which conceptual representation is predicted from multimodal vectors using a multilayer feed-forward neural network. The analysis of prediction performance demonstrates that the indirect grounding model achieves significantly better performance in predicting human conceptual representation of abstract words than other models that mimic competing views on abstract concepts, especially than the direct grounding model in which the visual vectors of abstract words are computed directly from the images of abstract concepts.

Because gender role stereotypes are reinforced by parental behavior, we aimed to examine the relationship of maternal gender stereotypes and children's fear. Dyads of 38 mothers and their daughters (between ages 6 and 10) were included. We assessed maternal implicit and explicit gender stereotypes as well as their daughters' self-reported general fearfulness, specific fear of snakes, and approach behavior toward a living snake. First, mothers' fear of snakes significantly correlated with their daughters' fear of snakes. Second, mothers' gender stereotypes significantly correlated with their daughters' self-reported fear. Specifically, maternal implicit gender stereotypes were associated with daughters' fear of snakes and fear ratings in response to the snake.

These studies do so in large part by assessing Christians' dominion and stewardship tendencies, about which they make two assumptions: (1) dominion ideology is inherently anti-environmental and (2) dominion and stewardship ideologies are opposed. Many Christians reject these assumptions, a fact we demonstrate by surveying Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and North American Evangelical sources. Each of these discourses, in clear contradistinction to the quantitative sociological literature, portray dominion as leading to self-sacrificial stewardship of creation, all of which is considered intrinsically valuable. Taking a 2015 study of Christians in Nigeria as a case-study, we demonstrate that this conflict between a) the perspectives assumed in the quantitative literature and b) the perspectives held by many Christians leads to a forced and distortive portrayal of these Christians' dominion and stewardship perspectives.

Further, we aimed to examine the variability in mean levels of psychopathic traits from age 9 to age 20 in a large community sample (N = 9136) using cross-sectional analysis. The study's findings provided evidence for age variability in psychopathic traits, since narcissism was found to be more prevalent from age 13-15, impulsivity from age 13 to 20, and CU traits from age 15-18. These findings demonstrate that psychopathic traits are less prevalent during childhood than adolescence. Further, the pattern of association between CD symptoms and psychopathic traits also displayed variability by age. Specifically, even though the overall regression of psychopathic traits on CD symptoms suggested that the three psychopathic dimensions had comparable impact on CD, the separate regressions by age group suggested that impulsivity was the strongest predictor of CD in childhood and early adolescence (ages 9-14), while narcissism was the strongest predictor of CD in mid-adolescence (ages 15-17).

However, daily substance use patterns may reveal how motivation changes during treatment. Neurocognitive principles of recency and expectancy indicate the salience of treatment mechanisms would increase on days proximal to therapy sessions. This study tested whether substance use decreased on days near treatment sessions. Method: Bayesian multilevel models were used in a secondary analysis of randomized clinical trial data comparing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), computerized CBT, and treatment as usual during outpatient SUD treatment (n = 94; 76% males; M-age = 38; 46% African American, 38% White, 6% multiracial, 10% other; 17% Hispanic). The number of days before/after a therapy session was used to predict daily substance use assessed by weekly self-reports. Results: The models suggested that substance use increased as more days passed after a therapy session (b = 5.23) and then decelerated before the next therapy session (b(2) = -8.20). The evidence indicated that substance use was less likely on therapy days and the days after therapy. Primary drug type, SUD severity, and treatment condition moderated these findings. Conclusions: Substance use patterns during treatment were consistent with recency and expectancy neurocognitive principles. Substance use decreased on days closer to a therapy session, suggesting that treatment mechanisms were more salient on those days. More frequent therapeutic contact and targeted timing of treatment delivery may enhance treatment efficacy.

The study's primary aim was to assess the measurement invariance of the BAS-2, BI-AAQ-5, and FAS between sexual minority and heterosexual women. The secondary aim was to assess the psychometric properties of each positive body image measure among each sample. Participants were predominantly White, cisgender women who identified as a sexual minority (n = 310) or heterosexual (n = 360) and completed online questionnaires of positive body image, eating behaviors, and mental and physical health. Results supported invariance with no differences in BAS-2 or BI-AAQ-5 scores.

Addressing these limitations, here we utilised arbitrary items (i.e., geometric shapes) and administered the Attention Network Test (ANT) to establish the extent to which self-relevance (vs friend-relevance) moderates the three subsystems of attentional functioning-alerting, orienting, and executive control.

Altered resting-state connectivity in the fronto-limbic system has been reported in maltreated individuals. However, previous results in smaller samples differ largely regarding localization and direction of effects. Methods We included healthy and depressed samples [n = 624 participants with MDD; n = 701 healthy control (HC) participants] that underwent resting-state functional MRI measurements and provided retrospective self-reports of maltreatment using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. A-priori defined regions of interest [ROI; amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)] were used to calculate seed-to-voxel connectivities. Results No significant associations between maltreatment and resting-state connectivity of any ROI were found across MDD and HC participants and no interaction effect with diagnosis became significant. Investigating MDD patients only yielded maltreatment-associated increased connectivity between the amygdala and dorsolateral frontal areas [p(FDR) < 0.001; eta(2)(partial) = 0.050; 95%-CI (0.023-0.085)]. This effect was robust across various sensitivity analyses and was associated with concurrent and previous symptom severity. Particularly strong amygdala-frontal associations with maltreatment were observed in acutely depressed individuals [n = 264; p(FDR) < 0.001; eta(2)(partial) = 0.091; 95%-CI (0.038-0.166)). Weaker evidence - not surviving correction for multiple ROI analyses - was found for altered supracallosal ACC connectivity in HC individuals associated with maltreatment. Conclusions The majority of previous resting-state connectivity correlates of CM could not be replicated in this large-scale study. The strongest evidence was found for clinically relevant maltreatment associations with altered adult amygdala-dorsolateral frontal connectivity in depression.

While studies in the general population and in autistic adults have drawn general links between sleep disturbances and mental health, few studies have examined the extent to which specific sleep problems may be implicated in the extremely high rates of depression among autistic adults. This study aimed to describe the patterns of sleep disturbances in autistic young adults, and their associations with depressive symptoms while controlling for relevant demographic factors. A sample of 304 legally independent adults (age 18-35 years old) with a childhood diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder self-reported on their average sleep behaviors during the past week and depressive symptoms on the Beck Depressive Inventory-II. A significant proportion (86.01%) of autistic young adults experienced at least one of the primary sleep disturbances of interest, including short total sleep time (39.59%), poor sleep efficiency (60.07%), and delayed sleep phase (36.18%). Additionally, lower sleep efficiency and delayed sleep phase were both associated with higher depressive symptoms. The associations between sleep and depressive symptoms identified in our study suggest that sleep treatments may hold potential for ameliorating depressive symptoms in autistic adults who also experience sleep problems. Further research using daily sleep diaries and objective measures of sleep behaviors, as well as longitudinal studies, are needed to understand how changes in sleep may relate to changes in depressive symptoms in autistic adults. Lay Summary Studies in the general population show that sleep disturbances may have a negative effect on mood. However, this relationship has not been sufficiently studied in autistic adults. More than 80% of autistic young adults in the study sample had sleep disturbances. Adults with certain sleep disturbances reported more depressive symptoms.

The present study extends previous research on these phenomena by examining the momentary dynamics of aberrant salience, anomalous self-experiences, and psychotic-like experiences in daily life. Participants were 246 young adults who were prompted to complete 6 smartphone surveys daily for 7 days. Baseline measures of aberrant salience and anomalous self-experiences each predicted occurrence of the same phenomena in daily life, supporting the use of these measures to examine within-subject changes. Dynamic structural equation modeling was used to examine lagged effects. Both aberrant salience and anomalous self-experiences exhibited carryover effects across timepoints. Furthermore, aberrant salience and anomalous self-experiences were each associated with psychotic-like experiences at subsequent timepoints, above and beyond the carryover effects of psychotic-like experiences.

We tested this through a service prototype, the agile Psychological Medicine clinic. Method Descriptive statistics were used to understand the characteristics of people who presented in crisis. Patient journey maps were used to understand the impact of the system on the patient and assess whether they received the best clinical care over time. Insights from these analyses, and the evidence base, led to the development of the prototype. Using an open trial design, 194 patients received specialist treatment and effectiveness was measured through patient-reported outcome measures administered at initial and final appointments. Service utilisation was measured 12-months pre and post treatment. Results The agile Psychological Medicine clinic delivered value; outcomes significantly improved across psychological symptomology and behaviours. Reductions in emergency department presentations, phone triage calls and service costs resulted. Conclusions This innovative clinic demonstrated that access to front-end mental health treatment improves clinical outcomes, mitigates later complications and increases the prospects of keeping patients well over the longer term. What is already known about this topic (1) Hospital emergency departments (EDs) can often be the initial point of care for people seeking immediate help for mental health crises. (2) Demand has increased, patient satisfaction has decreased and patients increasingly re-present in crisis. (3) Therapeutic alliance has been shown to be a robust predictor of treatment outcome.

First, the research analyzes the concepts of social media, CSR, and corporate reputation from the perspective of entrepreneurial psychology and expounds on the influencing factors of CSR scores from a macro perspective. Second, the mechanism of social media's role in CSR is briefly discussed. On this basis, it is found that the most intuitive manifestation of social media platforms affecting the communication of CSR is the impact on the score of CSR. Three hypotheses are proposed, namely, (1) social media platforms, such as ""WeChat,"" have a greater impact on the communication of CSR; (2) social media is positively correlated with the increase in CSR scores; and (3) user reading and liking are positively correlated with the increase in CSR scores. Finally, 78 listed companies related to the mobile communication industry are selected as samples for the questionnaire survey and statistical analysis, and the hypothesis is demonstrated. The results demonstrate that the hypothesis that the social media platform ""WeChat"" has an impact on the communication of CSR is valid, and the hypothesis that the open state of ""social media"" is positively correlated with the increase in CSR scores is not valid. It is assumed that the number of user readings and likes is positively correlated with the increase in CSR score, which is valid under a limited sample. It is concluded that the WeChat platform has the best effect on the communication of CSR and can provide the impetus for the improvement of corporate reputation. The opening of ""social media"" is not directly related to the improvement of CSR scores. The correct operation of ""social media"" will have an impact on the communication of CSR. The correlation between the number of users reading and liking on ""social media"" and the increase in CSR score is not significant, as only the number of ""likes"" on social media related to shareholders is significantly associated with an increase in CSR score. The linear regression coefficient between the number of likes and the increase in CSR score is less than 0.05. There is a positive correlation between user reads, likes, and increases in CSR scores. This research helps enterprises to effectively fulfill their social responsibilities and improve the efficiency of CSR.

A ""shelter in place"" mandate was issued in March 2020. The effect on vulnerable populations of adolescent and young adult females has not been well documented.
Methods: We administered a monthly online survey between May and November 2020 to adolescent and young adult females participating in a longitudinal study at Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center. Surveys asked about death of loved ones, financial impacts, social interactions, exposure to dangerous situations, and mental health impacts. Differences in responses by age, race/ethnicity, and living situation were assessed, and compared to data obtained on the same cohort prior to the pandemic.
Results: Four hundred seventeen females aged 15-28 years completed at least one survey, 94% of whom were youth of color. A third of responders (33%) had lost relatives or other people they were close to (loved ones). Most (68%) reported one or more financial losses, and 21% reported food insecurity, with those not living with parents or a guardian experiencing significantly higher rates. One in 10 reported experiencing sexual abuse or interpersonal partner violence during the ""shelter in place"" period. Over a third (37%) reported symptoms of clinical depression, which represented a significant increase compared to before the pandemic (p = .01). The negative financial impacts and higher proportion of patients with depressive symptomatology remained elevated for adolescents without support at home.
Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic had unprecedented negative short-term financial and psychosocial health impacts on inner-city female youth with potential long-term negative impacts.

Movements such as the anti-establishment, internet-born conspiracy theory QAnon are offered as dramatic cases of just how ""irrational"" people have become in a ""post-truth"" political world. However, with a growing number of everyday Americans believing in such theories, labeling adherents ""irrational"" ignores the internally rationalizing logic of conspiracy theories, so we ask the question: how do QAnon followers think through, argue, and rationalize their political truths? This paper establishes a discursive framework that demonstrates how QAnon adherents translate the theory's paradigmatic political epistemology into personal ideologies. I identify the narrative structures that guide belief, examining how QAnon followers develop a general political plot, set the parameters for conflict, embrace their role in the story, determine what is in the political canon, and relate to the narrative that has been constructed. This analysis highlights the contradictions within the QAnon conspiracy theory-not to pathologize adherents' irrationality but to demonstrate how people must wrestle with contradiction, paradox, and confusion when developing political ideologies. When framed as the as victims of a brainwashing cult, QAnons routinely respond, ""no cult tells you to think for yourself""; instead, their narratives allow them to interpret QAnon in service of developing personalized political truths. Thus, this paper takes their words at face value to see the world as they interpret it. I argue that ideologies are a function of broader political epistemologies such as QAnon; they are embodied, narrativized ways of being in the world that make life livable-despite any inner contradictions-and guide political participation.",MAY 2023,67,2023,2022-05-04,MAY,Journal,N,0002-7642,1552-3381,10.1177/00027642221091199,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST,"""No Cult Tells You to Think for Yourself"": Discursive Ideology and the Limits of Rationality in Conspiracy Theory QAnon",AM BEHAV SCI,Am.

Participants looked significantly longer at filled compared with empty targets, and target looking during encoding only predicted accuracy in case of filled targets. Increased pupil dilation was observed in response to an increasing number of items, while pupil diameter was unaffected by the number of empty locations. In addition, participants made significantly more errors in the conditions that involved the representation of an empty location.

This research explores coaches' views of bullying in professional soccer academies and how it is framed in relation to banter. Five professional soccer coaches were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. The methodology and analysis were guided by interpretative phenomenological analysis. Coaches highlighted key components which identify bullying in professional soccer environments, such as intent to harm; frequency of behaviour; and an imbalance of power. Coaches also highlighted different individual and contextual factors which separated bullying from banter. These included individual differences; unintentional behaviour; immaturity; and the masculinity of the soccer culture. These findings provide an important extension to the bullying literature in sport by highlighting coaches' own perspectives on this concept within the professional soccer context. The findings also illustrate the subtle nuances through which coaches separate bullying from banter. As such, important applied implications are discussed for the development of coach education programmes to raise greater awareness around these concepts as well as the potential consequences of bullying and banter on player welfare in professional soccer.",NOV 2 2022,20,2022,2021-10-09,NOV 2,Journal,N,1612-197X,1557-251X,10.1080/1612197X.2021.1987966,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT AND EXERCISE PSYCHOLOGY,When it is no longer a bit of banter: Coaches' perspectives of bullying in professional soccer,INT J SPORT EXERC PS,Int.

Methods: U.S. adults (N = 319) completed online questionnaires assessing depression-related beliefs, attitudes and experience. Multiple regression analysis focused on predictive effects of neurobiological and genetic attributions. Potential mediators (prognosis) and moderators (experience) of the biological attribution-stigma link also were tested. Results: Neurobiological attributions predicted viewing depression as more consequential, longer lasting, and unexpectedly, more treatable. Neurobiological attributions were inversely related to stigma, a link partially mediated by beliefs about depression's consequences and duration. However, both biological attributions' relationships to stigma were moderated by experience.

Objective: The current study examined child, caregiver, family, neighborhood, and maltreatment factors in relation to past-year mental health service use among at-risk eight-year-old children. Cumulative and types of maltreatment were both investigated to help elucidate the role of these experiences. Participants/setting/method: Eight hundred and forty-five eight-year-old at-risk children (48.3 % male; 59.5 % Black) from the Longitudinal Studies in Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) were included. Results: A small portion of children (12.4 %) received psychological help in the previous year. Children's externalizing symptoms, residing with a non-biological caregiver, cumulative maltreatment and sexual and emotional abuse were associated with seeking psychological services, whereas physical abuse, neglect, and domestic violence exposure were not. Other caregiver factors, and family and neighborhood factors were also unrelated. Conclusions: Non-biological caregivers as well as caregivers of children with higher levels of externalizing symptoms may be more inclined to seek out mental health services, along with greater, and specific, maltreatment experiences.

Telomere length is a biomarker of chronic stress that is predictive of adverse health outcomes. This study examined whether paternal incarceration predicted telomere length shortening among offspring from childhood to adolescence, whether maternal depression mediated the link, and whether ethnicity/race moderated results.
Method: Research participants included 2,395 families in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study, a national and longitudinal cohort study of primarily low-income families from 20 large cities in the United States. Key constructs were measured when children were on average ages 9 (20072010) and 15 (2014-2017).
Results: Children who experienced paternal incarceration exhibited shorter telomere lengths between ages 9 and 15, and changes in maternal depression mediated this finding. Specifically, mothers who experienced a partner's incarceration were more likely to have depression between children's ages 9 and 15. In turn, increases in maternal depression between children's ages 9 and 15 predicted more accelerated telomere length shortening among children during this period. Paternal incarceration was more prevalent and frequent for ethnic/racial minority youth than for White youth.
Conclusion: Paternal incarceration is associated with a biomarker of chronic stress among children in low-income families. Rates of paternal incarceration were more prevalent and frequent among Black American and multiethnic/multiracial families than among White Americans.

Prepandemic to pandemic changes in SR were compared with repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: There were significant decreases in child SR (poorer concentration, attention, task engagement and persistence, and greater impulsivity) prepandemic to pandemic. During the pandemic, parenting stress was correlated with lower child SR (r range = -0.52 to -0.34, p < 0.05). Pandemic-related family disruptions were associated with changes in children's impulsivity (F [1, 42] = 5.28, p = 0.03); children with 4 or more disruptions (67%) showed less ability to wait their turn during the pandemic compared with prepandemic (M [SD] = 3.34 [0.93] vs. 4.41 [1.21], t [28] = 3.93, p < 0.001).

First, the number of modules, variability accounted for (VAF), and muscle weightings extracted by the NNMF algorithm were compared between the conditions. Next, a modified NNMF algorithm, in which the activation timing profiles among different GCs were unified, was performed to compare the muscle weightings more robustly between GCs. The number of motor modules was not significantly different, regardless of the GCs. The difference in VAF and muscle weightings in the different GCs decreased with the LPF of 4 Hz. Muscle weightings in 15 GCs or less were significantly different from those in 25 GCs using the modified NNMF.

Previous research has shown that compassion interventions for healthcare professionals can decrease work-related stress through the introduction of self-care, self-awareness, and emotion regulation abilities when experiencing difficult situations. Internet-based stress management interventions have hitherto shown promising results in reducing stress. However, further research is needed to examine the effectiveness of internet-based compassion interventions for healthcare professionals.
Objective: In the present study protocol, a randomised controlled trial is described, aiming to examine the effects of an internet-based compassion course for healthcare professionals on work-related stress and stress of conscience.
Method: Healthcare professionals will be offered an internet-based stress management course of five modules across a period of five weeks. The design is a randomised controlled study consisting of three groups enrolled in one of the following: a compassion course (n = 120), a cognitive behavioural stress management course (n = 120), or placed on a waitlist followed by either the compassion course or the cognitive behavioural stress management course (n = 36). We hypothesise that the internet-based compassion course would reduce the participants' stress of conscience to a greater degree compared to the other two groups. The secondary hypothesis is that the compassion course would increase the participants' professional quality of life (i.e., higher job satisfaction and lower empathy fatigue) and self-compassion. In addition, the internet-based compassion course is expected to reduce the participants' work-related stress and sick leave rates to the same degree (non-inferiority) as the cognitive behavioural stress management course and to a higher degree when compared to the waitlist condition. The primary outcome measure is the Stress of Conscience Questionnaire (SCQ) and the secondary outcome measures are the Professional Quality of Life Scale (PROQOL), the Work-related Stress Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ), and the Self-compassion Scale (SCS). Assessments will be performed at baseline, four weekly assessments during treatment, post-treatment (5 weeks), and follow-ups at 10 weeks, 15 weeks, and 6 months. The repeated measures data will be analysed using a generalised estimating equation for repeated measurements to examine whether changes over time differ between the groups and whether the improvements persist over time.
Discussion: The clinical trial is expected to provide novel data on the effects of compassion interventions and add to the existing knowledge of internet-based interventions for stress management in healthcare professionals.",APR 2022,28,2022,2022-04-01,APR,Journal,Y,NA,2214-7829,10.1016/j.invent.2021.100463,NA,MEDLINE:35646603,NA,NA,NA,INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH,An internet-based compassion course for healthcare professionals: Rationale and protocol for a randomised controlled trial,INTERNET INTERV,Internet Interv.,INTE INTERV,INTERNET INTERV,1,publisher,ELSEVIER,1,ELSEVIER,INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH

Despite widespread availability of Al-Anon meetings, participation is limited and little is known about how to best facilitate engagement. Al-Anon Intensive Referral (AIR) was developed to facilitate COs' engagement in Al-Anon and is being tested in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Toward the end of the recruitment for the RCT, a qualitative formative evaluation was conducted to learn about facilitators, barriers, and recommendations for AIR implementation in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment clinics. Methods: Thirty-one directors and staff at ten VA and community SUD clinics were interviewed. Semi-structured interviews were based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and were thematically analyzed to identify facilitators, barriers, and recommendations for AIR implementation. Results: Perceived facilitators of AIR implementation included AIR's face validity, adaptability, and alignment with staff values and skills, requiring only minimal training. Several interviewees in community settings thought AIR would fit with their current practices (e.g., family groups), and some clinics reported having sufficient staff available for delivering AIR. Perceived barriers included limited staff time, and VA clinics having limited resources for providing services to COs. Furthermore, many clients have no COs, or COs who are unwilling or unable to engage with them. Recommendations included fitting AIR within existing workflows and focusing on COs with highest readiness to receive support. Interviewees also thought AIR could be adapted to a website format or smartphone app, which may expand its reach while decreasing staff burden and cost; however, it may not be as effective and appealing to some demographic groups (e.g., older COs). Conclusions: AIR has strong potential for implementation in SUD treatment settings, but clinics vary on implementation capacity. Most clinics could implement AIR partially (e.g., case-by-case basis) while clinics with sufficient capacity (e.g., staff time) could implement it more fully. These findings can also inform implementation of other interventions for concerned others.",JAN 2022,132,2022,2021-06-07,JAN,Journal,N,0740-5472,1873-6483,10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108520,NA,MEDLINE:34111772,NA,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT,Al-Anon Intensive Referral (AIR): A qualitative formative evaluation for implementation,J SUBST ABUSE TREAT,J.

The current investigation found that preschoolers' overall self-regulation predicted their academic skills in middle childhood, net of child and family characteristics as well as academic competence during preschool. Furthermore, when executive function (EF) and effortful control (EC) in early childhood were examined as simultaneous predictors of quantitative and literacy scores during middle childhood, there were moderate linkages from EF to both academic domains.

Methods: During the Wave 4 (2013-2017) visit of the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Longitudinal Study (HANDLS), Black adults who were in a relationship (N = 433; mean age = 55.26, SD = 9.30; 51% men) provided self-report data on IPV perpetration; frequency of racial discrimination; and levels of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Multigroup mediation models used these cross-sectional data to test whether racial discrimination was associated with MH symptoms, which in turn were associated with IPV perpetration, determining the significance of direct and indirect pathways and whether any pathways varied by poverty status or gender. Results: Racial discrimination was associated with more MH symptoms, which in turn was associated with IPV perpetration. The negative effect of discrimination on MH was stronger for Black women than Black men and for Black adults with household incomes below 125% of the Federal poverty line than those with incomes above this cutoff. Discussion: Efforts to prevent and treat IPV in the Black community should address the negative effects of racial discrimination experiences on MH and partner aggression, especially among those with multiple marginalized identities. IPV prevention efforts may be enhanced through an overarching commitment to dismantle structural racism and intersectional forms of oppression.
What is the public health significance of this article? The present study indicates that racial discrimination is a risk factor for intimate partner violence perpetration among Black individuals living in urban neighborhoods due to its association with mental health symptoms (anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder).

We test our ideas by examining scenarios where award-winning CEOs feel especially entitled and therefore are most likely to commit misconduct. Using a sample of award-winning CEOs from Chinese publicly listed firms, we find that award-winning CEOs are more likely to commit financial misconduct in the post-award period than in the pre-award period. In addition, the effect of winning a CEO award on financial misconduct is stronger when CEOs are underpaid or from industries in which awards are rare and therefore more special.

Because cognition may be plastic, shaped through experience with the cultural products of others, collective cognitive alignment and stable cultural attractors cannot always be taken for granted, but little is known about how these patterns first emerge and stabilize in initially uncoordinated populations. We propose that stable cultural attractors can emerge from general principles of human categorization and communication. We present a model of cultural attractor dynamics, which extends a model of unsupervised category learning in individuals to a multiagent setting wherein learners provide the training input to each other. Agents in our populations spontaneously align their cognitive category structures, producing emergent cultural attractor points. We highlight three interesting behaviors exhibited by our model: (1) noise enhances the stability of cultural category structures; (2) short 'critical' periods of learning early in life enhance stability; and (3) larger populations produce more stable but less complex attractor landscapes, and cliquish network structure can mitigate the latter effect.

Therefore, the present study utilizes the panel data of Chinese A-share listed companies collected from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research (CSMAR) database from 2011 to 2020 to conduct empirical research. It tests the policy effect of tax incentives on enterprise R&D investment and examines the impact of tax enforcement on enterprise R&D behavior and its moderating effect on the relationship between tax incentives and enterprise R&D investment. The results show that China's preferential tax policies positively affect enterprise innovation activities, and stable and continuous tax incentives can stimulate enterprises to increase R&D investment. Increasing the intensity of tax enforcement has a significant positive impact on enterprise R&D investment, which means that the promotion effect of ""governance effect"" and ""incentive effect"" caused by tax enforcement may exceed the negative impact brought by its ""taxation effect"" and ""rent-seeking effect."" The study suggests that with the strengthening of tax enforcement, the promotion effect of tax incentives is weakened, which is only reflected in non-state-owned enterprises.

It is often used off-label for treating anxiety conditions and as an augmentation agent for treatment-resistant depression. However, its benefit in depression with comorbid anxiety disorders has not been systematically evaluated. The current study evaluated the benefit and tolerability of quetiapine as augmentation to first-line antidepressants for MDD comorbid with anxiety disorders.
Methods: In this multicenter trial (June 2008-June 2013), 76 adults (aged 18-65 years) with a primary diagnosis of unipolar depression comorbid with at least 1 anxiety disorder (per DSM-IV-TR criteria) received flexible-dose quetiapine extended-release (XR) 50-300 mg/d or placebo as add-on for 12 weeks in a 2:1 ratio. Depression, anxiety, life satisfaction, and adverse events were assessed.
Results: Depression, anxiety, and function improved significantly in both groups.

This association remained significant after adjusting for baseline educational aspiration and multiple provincial and sociodemographic covariates. The effects of gender inequality did not differ between boys and girls, suggesting that gender inequality was detrimental for both boys' and girls' long-term educational aspiration. The current study highlights the important role of gender inequality in education and underscores the importance of looking beyond individual factors and the proximal context in understanding adolescents' educational aspiration. Our findings suggest the importance of reducing socio-structural gender biases and institutional impediments (e.g., expectations to perform gendered role, women's underrepresentation) which constrain both girls' and boys' educational aspiration and development.",MAR 2022,86,2022,2022-01-31,MAR,Journal,N,0360-0025,1573-2762,10.1007/s11199-021-01272-z,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,SEX ROLES,Gender Inequality Lowers Educational Aspiration for Adolescent Boys and Girls: A Multi-Level and Longitudinal Study in China,SEX ROLES,Sex Roles,SEX ROLES,SEX ROLES,1,publisher,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,1,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,SEX ROLES

In this study, 595 participants completed four divergent thinking tasks; originality and degree of elaboration were scored for each idea, and multilevel analyses were used to model both originality and elaboration as a function of serial order and total fluency. Later ideas were found to be more original, replicating the serial order effect, but there was an antagonistic effect of sequence length: The ideas of participants with lower fluency tended to be both more original and more elaborate, regardless of serial position. In sum, generating more ideas actually came with lower originality for each idea, despite a serial order effect.

Logistic regression analyses were finally carried out to identify their determinants. Six items were removed from the item analysis. EFA supported the existence of two factors (ATL and ATG). CFA results indicated that the two-factor model fit the data better than the one-factor model. Logistic regression analyses indicated that being female, majoring in non-health-related disciplines, attributing homosexuality to uncontrollable causes, non-adherence to traditional gender norms and exposure to homosexual content were significantly associated with less negative attitudes toward both L and G. Urban students were marginally less likely to express negative attitudes toward L but not G, while non-heterosexuals and those who had prior personal contact with homosexuals exhibited less negative attitudes toward G but not L. However, grade showed no significant associations with either ATL or ATG. The retained 14-item version of Herek's ATLG scale has been proven to be a reliable and valid tool.

Existing research finds that disability serves as a chronic stressor, and those with disabilities report higher rates of substance use than their able-bodied counterparts. Therefore, this research will be among the first to combine the social model of disability with the stress process framework. It will examine the relationship between impairment and substance use and how disability, as a measure of chronic stress, may affect this relationship.

Findings reveal that those with an impairment have significantly greater odds of having a substance use disorder.

Views diverge whether resilience intervenes as a trait or as a process of dynamic interactions of protective factors, such as self-esteem, social support and family cohesion. We evaluated five theoretically-based models of how resilience, defined as either a trait or a process, interacts with recent SLEs, to explain depressive symptomatology in 2434 university students. The moderating effect of problematic, age-inappropriate parenting (i.e., helicopter parenting) was also assessed. SLEs moderated both the effects of trait and process resilience on depression, but models conceptualising resilience as a dynamic process of interacting components showed better explanatory power than models conceptualising resilience solely as a trait. Trait resilience was protective through self-esteem at all levels of SLEs exposure (low, mild, moderate or high), and significantly, but less so through hope or social support. Experiencing helicopter parenting weakened the protective influence of process resilience, through decreasing family cohesion in the presence of SLEs. The overall assessment of the five models supports a process conceptualisation of resilience to depression in the face of adversity. However, the results also suggest that not all protective factors are equally important, with self-esteem appearing a significant and strong mediator of resilience to depression in all models including it as a variable. Building process resilience is proposed as a key intervention target for depressive symptoms. Clinical assessments and interventions following SLEs should routinely consider both trait resilience and self-esteem, as the interaction of these two factors protects against depression even at the highest levels of adversity exposure.

To address this gap, we conducted a preregistered (German Clinical Trials Register [Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien; DRKS], Registration DRKS00008107) combined functional magnetic resonance (fMRI)/eye tracking study in which 38 women with BED and 22 healthy controls weight-matched for overall equivalence processed images of their own bodies, an unfamiliar weight-matched body, and visually matched nonbody control stimuli while performing a one-back task. Women with BED responded with higher left fusiform body area (FBA) activity than controls during body image processing. Despite higher levels of self-reported body dissatisfaction, women with BED did not show overactivation in emotion-processing areas in response to their own body. The eye-tracking results indicated that visual attention toward the presented stimuli was associated with increased activity in the extrastriate body area (EBA) and FBA across groups. Our results thus provide evidence for an aberrant neural processing of body images in BED and highlight the importance of controlling for visual attention in future studies assessing neuronal body processing.
General Scientific Summary
This study is the first to investigate neural correlates of body image disturbances in binge eating disorder (BED). The results show that compared to a healthy control group, women with BED respond to body images with increased activity in a brain area that plays a central role in the visual processing of body stimuli.",MAY 2022,131,2022,2022-05-01,MAY,Journal,N,2769-7541,2769-755X,10.1037/abn0000750,NA,MEDLINE:35511524,NA,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND CLINICAL SCIENCE,Neural Correlates of Body Image Processing in Binge Eating Disorder,J PSYCHOPATHOL CLIN,J.

The present study replicated and extended prior findings of suboptimal automation use in a signal detection task, benchmarking automation-aided performance to the predictions of several statistical models of collaborative decision making.
Background
Though automated decision aids can assist human operators to perform complex tasks, operators often use the aids suboptimally, achieving performance lower than statistically ideal.
Method
Participants performed a simulated security screening task requiring them to judge whether a target (a knife) was present or absent in a series of colored X-ray images of passenger baggage. They completed the task both with and without assistance from a 93%-reliable automated decision aid that provided a binary text diagnosis. A series of three experiments varied task characteristics including the timing of the aid's judgment relative to the raw stimuli, target certainty, and target prevalence.
Results and Conclusion
Automation-aided performance fell closest to the predictions of the most suboptimal model under consideration, one which assumes the participant defers to the aid's diagnosis with a probability of 50%. Performance was similar across experiments.
Application
Results suggest that human operators' performance when undertaking a naturalistic search task falls far short of optimal and far lower than prior findings using an abstract signal detection task.",SEP 2022,64,2022,2021-01-28,SEP,Journal,N,0018-7208,1547-8181,10.1177/0018720820983632,NA,MEDLINE:33508964,NA,NA,NA,HUMAN FACTORS,Measuring the Efficiency of Automation-Aided Performance in a Simulated Baggage Screening Task,HUM FACTORS,Hum.

We conducted a systematic exploration of his topo-graphical problems to identify their cognitive substrate.Standard neuropsychological examination revealed no abnormalities. Notably, he per-formed well on perceptual, spatial, and constructional tasks. No signs of neglect were elicited. A tailored battery of tests was administered, involving road maps and landmarks, and designed to replicate the situations in which he experienced symptoms. The experimental tests showed no evidence of topographical agnosia or amnesia for landmarks and their spatial relationships and no hemispatial neglect. Nevertheless, the patient exhibited a systematic tendency to translocate topographical landmarks sited on the left to the right side. The phe-nomenon, consistent with representational allochiria, occurred exclusively for topographical landmarks, and was present along both personally familiar and new learned routes.Over the next two years more widespread visuoperceptual and spatial deficits emerged, with Balint and Gerstmann syndromes. Functional imaging revealed hypoperfusion of the occipito-parietal regions and amyloid PET the presence of amyloid plaques.

To further understand racialized dating preferences among this underrepresented population, we examined the extent to which internalized racism and resistance and empowerment against racism were associated with queer Asian American men's dating preferences (i.e., Asian preference, White preference, or no racial preference). We also investigated the mediating role of self-efficacy in the associations of internalized racism and empowerment against racism with the different dating preferences. Cross-sectional data were collected from a sample of 180 queer Asian American men who completed an online survey. Results showed that internalized racism was positively associated with a White dating preference and negatively associated with an Asian dating preference. Resistance and empowerment was positively associated with having no racial dating preference and was negatively associated with a White dating preference. Furthermore, self-efficacy mediated a negative indirect association of resistance and empowerment with having a White dating preference, whereas self-efficacy did not mediate any other associations. The results of our study highlight the importance of considering psychological, racially relevant factors that may be associated with queer Asian American men's racialized dating preferences.

The primary goal of this study was to examine age-related changes in naming static and dynamic spatial relations across the adult lifespan. Moreover, we examined whether spatial naming is more closely associated with (non-spatial) verbal or (non-linguistic) visuospatial abilities. Method: Healthy adults aged between 18 and 85 years completed a newly developed Spatial Naming Test (SNT), as well as standard object and action naming tests and various visuospatial tasks. The psychometric properties of the novel SNT (inter-rater and test-retest reliability and convergent, divergent, and construct validity) were also examined. Results: The psychometric evaluation confirmed the reliability and validity of the SNT. Striking effects of ageing on naming of both static and dynamic spatial relations were found, as well as on visuospatial abilities, while object and action naming remained age invariant. Moreover, both (non-spatial) verbal and (non-linguistic) visuospatial abilities predicted static spatial naming, but only visuospatial abilities accounted for significant variance in dynamic spatial naming beyond age. Conclusions: These findings provide the first evidence that naming spatial relations declines in ageing as a function of changes in non-linguistic visuospatial abilities, indicating strong connections between linguistic and non-linguistic representations of space.

There are several theories of how local-to-global pooling occurs, but they all predict that global motion perception is a continuous process, such that increasing the strength of motion energy should gradually increase the precision of perceived motion directions. We test this prediction against the alternative that global motion perception is discrete: Motion is either perceived with high precision or fails to be perceived altogether. Data from human observers provides clear evidence that, whereas pooling local motion energy is continuous, the segmentation of local signals into coherent global motion patterns is a discrete process. This result adds motion perception to the growing list of processes that exhibit evidence of all-or-none visual awareness.
Public Significance Statement Visual perception requires that objects are isolated from other objects, a process that is accomplished in part by analyzing motion energy across space. For example, although individual parts of a running dog may be moving in many directions at any moment, all of them share motion energy in the direction he's running, which helps the visual system to build the perception of a coherently moving object. This global motion process develops early in life, and deficits in it have been identified in disorders including autism, dyslexia, and schizophrenia. Whereas current theories of global motion perception predict that motion perception is analog, taking on any value from weak to strong, here we show that it is discrete: coherent motion is either perceived nearly perfectly, or not at all. This finding suggests that current models of global motion perception, and theories of why deficits in this process occur, may require substantial revision.",JAN 2022,48,2022,2022-01-01,JAN,Journal,N,0096-1523,1939-1277,10.1037/xhp0000971,NA,MEDLINE:35073143,NA,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-HUMAN PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE,"Local Motion Pooling Is Continuous, Global Motion Perception Is Discrete",J EXP PSYCHOL HUMAN,J.

First, across three data sets, we replicate Chudy's finding that racial sympathy and resentment are empirically distinct constructs. Second, based on a national-level 2019 YouGov survey (n = 760 White respondents) and consistent with Chudy's thesis, racial sympathy is then shown to be significantly related to the race-specific view that capital punishment is discriminatory but not support for the death penalty or harsher courts. Racial sympathy also is positively associated with advocacy of rehabilitation as the main goal of prison. Notably, in all models, racial resentment has robust effects, increasing punitive sentiments.

Although diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders is the primary focus of mental health clinicians, military chaplains are often the first contact made by service members seeking help for mental health concerns, due in part to issues of greater accessibility, ensured confidentiality, and less stigma. There is growing recognition of the importance of spirituality in the well-being and readiness of service members, as many mental health issues have a spiritual dimension. As a result, chaplains and mental health clinicians often address many of the same issues, albeit with different approaches.

Objectives: To assess OTP behaviors in a sample of adolescent and young adult e-cigarette users, including use prevalence, dual/poly use with other products, and associated demographics. Methods: A national (United States) cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to April 2021 among 2253 participants (ages 14-20; 65% female) who ever used e-cigarettes >= 3 times. Demographics, lifetime use, and past 30-day use of 10 tobacco and cannabis products, including novel and conventional (chew, moist snuff, or snus) OTPs was assessed. Analysis was descriptive, examining use prevalence (lifetime and past 30-day) of each product, including by demographics and other product use. Results: Nearly 44% reported ever using any OTP, with nicotine pouches being the most commonly ever used (29%) and used in the past month (11%). Novel OTP use was more common among older participants (18-20 years), male participants, and past 30-day users of e-cigarettes, combustible tobacco, and conventional oral tobacco. However, female participants and combustible tobacco non-users were over twice and 4-times as likely, respectively, to use novel OTPs than conventional OTPs.

This development has a considerable impact on the informal communication between AVs and pedestrians. Informal communication with the driver wi l l become obsolete during the interaction with AVs. Literature suggests that external human machine interfaces (eHMIs) might substitute the communication between drivers and pedestrians. In the study, we additionally test a recently discussed type of communication in terms of artificial vehicle motion, namely active pitch mo-tion, as an informal communication cue for AVs.
N = 54 participants approached AVs in a virtual inner-city traffic environment. We explored the effect of three communication concepts: an artificial vehicle motion, namely active pitch motion, eHMI and the combination of both. Moreover, vehicle types (sports car, limousine, SUV) were varied. A mixed-method approach was applied to investigate the participants 'crossing behavior and subjective safety feeling. Furthermore, eye movement parameters were recorded as indicators for mental workload.
The results revealed that any communication concept drove beneficial effects on the crossing behavior. The participants crossed the road earlier when an active pitch motion was present, as this was interpreted as a stronger braking. Further, the eHMI and a combination of eHMI and active pitch motion had a positive effect on the crossing behavior. The active pitch motion showed no effect on the subjective safety feeling, while eHMI and the combination enhanced the pedestrians 'safety feeling while crossing. The use of communication resulted in less mental workload, as evidenced by eye-tracking parameters. Variations of vehicle types did not resul t in significant main effects but revealed interactions between parameters. The active pitch motion revealed no learning. In contrast, it took participants several trials for the eHMI and the com-bination condition to affect their crossing behavior.

We hypothesized that some nonverbal features hierarchically function as ""superordinate"" or ""subordinate"" in sensory-perceptual dimensions representing emotions corresponding with verbal features. We focused on sadness as a target emotion and conducted a picture-word congruency judgment experiment. This study used 16 bodily-expression photographs (four-level trunk inclinations x four-level hand-arm postures) as sensory-perceptual features and 32 crying-related words as verbal features that prototypically represent sadness. Forty-eight participants assessed congruency concerning all combinations between bodily-expression pictures and crying-related words. Using a network graph analysis, bodily expressions were classified into three communities based on congruence ratings: the dominant bodily-expression community showed the highest verbal congruency composed of around-eye and overall-face hand-arm postures, irrespective of trunk inclination. Within this dominant community, trunk inclination subordinately modulated picture-word congruency according to bodily-activation properties.

We measured parental resilience and distress, anxiety, problematic behaviors, and somatization of their children (as assessed by the parents). The aim was to investigate the protective role of parental resilience in mitigating parental distress and in turn problematic emotional states and behavior of their children. Mediation analyses confirmed the hypothesis that parental resilience lowers parental distress and consequently the anxiety and behavioral disorders of their children in both acute distress (first study) and chronic distress (second study) situations. Such results suggest that the improvement of parents' resilience can buffer the negative impact of pandemic-related parental distress and children's behavioral problems on both occasions.

Combining different techniques of coding and statistical analyses, we identify seven basic types of EHEs. The most common type is denoted as the experience of interconnectedness with the main effect of a higher emphasis on unity and love. Together with six other identified types, it forms a coherent worldview that closely resembles the ""Being-values"" defined by Abraham Maslow. These values are at the core of the process of self-actualization of an individual and typically include notions of interconnectedness, unity, wholeness, simplicity, essentiality, just-rightness, spontaneity, effortlessness, benevolence, honesty, autonomy, and individuality. We conclude that the main effect of walking the Camino is a boost in self-actualization as understood in terms of humanistic psychology.

Therefore, drawing on job design theories and bridging turnover- and aging research, we studied 15 specific job characteristics to determine whether they predicted turnover intentions, and whether the predictive value was modified by age. MethodsData were collected from various public and private enterprises in Norway. Moderated multilevel regressions were conducted cross-sectionally (N = 12,485) and prospectively over 2 years (N = 5,504). ResultsMost work factors were associated with turnover intention at both the individual and work unit levels. A social climate of support, trust, and encouragement was most strongly inversely associated with turnover intentions, while role conflict was most strongly positively associated with turnover intentions. Organizational climate, leadership styles, and job control were more important with age while job demands, predictability and role stressors were more important to younger workers. Ten individual level- and four work-unit level factors predicted turnover intentions prospectively, suggesting turnover intentions due to poor working conditions persisted in employees that did not quit.

However, it is unclear if teachers' physiological stress is related to child-centred teaching practices in the classroom and whether teaching practices mediate the link between teachers' stress and students' learning outcomes. Aims We studied the effect of teachers' physiological stress and self-reported stress on their teaching practices and thereby on students' learning outcomes in math. Sample A total of 53 classroom teachers and 866 Grade 1 students participated in the study. Methods Salivary cortisol in the middle of the school day and cortisol slope from morning peak to evening were used as indicators of teachers' physiological stress, in addition to self-reported teaching-related stress. Teaching practices were observed with the ECCOM instrument. Students' math skills controlled for gender and previous skills were used as a measure of learning outcomes. Data were analysed with a two-level SEM. Results Teachers' physiological stress did not have an effect on teaching practices or students' math skills. Teachers reporting less stress used relatively more child-centred teaching practices compared with teacher-directed ones.

One such debate pertains to the nature of perfectionistic strivings. Whereas perfectionistic concerns (PC) have been shown to correlate with negative outcomes, perfectionistic strivings (PS) have been associated with mixed outcomes. This view of perfectionism assumes a motivational perspective; however, commonly used questionnaires assess motivation only implicitly. To create a more explicit measure of motivation as regard perfectionism, we aimed to assess perfectionism in post-secondary education based on Deci and Ryan's self-determination continuum. We posit that introjected motivation represents the variance common to both dimensions of perfectionism. External motivation is considered to be specific to PC and identified motivation to PS. Amotivation represents a lack of meaningful striving. Intrinsic motivation, lacking perfectionism's pressure, is conceptualized to be a self-determined form of striving for excellence. We further posited that this continuum is implicitly underlain by a continuum of self-definition as defined by Blatt.

This study provides initial results on cognitive outcomes in Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Participants and Methods: This study examined 53 consecutive outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Four participants were excluded due to performance validity test failure. All participants had positive COVID-19 tests, reported cognitive concerns, and completed neuropsychological tests to assess performance validity, attention/working memory, processing speed, memory, language, visual-spatial, executive functioning, motor, and emotional functioning. The sample was mostly white (89.8%), female (83.7%), and never hospitalized (69.4%) for COVID-19. Results: Analyses indicated no mean scores in the Impaired range (>2 standard deviations [SD] below normative mean) on objective cognitive testing and a low base rate of Impaired test scores. Higher (>20%) base rates of Borderline performance (1-2 SDs below normative mean) were found on some measures. There was also evidence for frequently elevated mean scores on mood measures which correlated with some cognitive measures and the number of Borderline scores per participants. Conclusions: The results were noteworthy for infrequent Impaired scores, and significant correlations between cognition and mood/anxiety measures, but not between cognitive performance and premorbid vascular risk factors, psychiatric diagnoses, or COVID-19 disease severity. Results suggest that psychological distress was prominent in PASC and related to objective cognitive performance, but objective cognitive performance was unrelated to cognitive complaints. Other contributing factors may include fatigue/sleep issues. Neurologically based cognitive deficits were not suggested by the results. During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers and clinicians have gained considerable knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 illness. Research has implicated COVID-19 in a variety of neurological and psychiatric issues (Taquet et al., 2021) including stroke, depression/anxiety, and more rarely intracranial hemorrhage and psychotic disorders. Further, various vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been associated with more severe COVID-19 symptoms (Bauer et al., 2021; Luk et al., 2021; Mishra et al., 2020; Saxena et al., 2021). Additionally, while many patients recover from COVID-19 in a few weeks, a substantial number continue to experience physical (e.g., fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, palpitations) and cognitive (e.g., ""brain fog"", concentration and memory complaints) symptoms for a considerable period (Raveendran et al., 2021). It has also been suggested that patients themselves, via social media, contributed to reifying the phenomenon of ""Long COVID-19"" or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC; Callard & Perego, 2021).

Promoting resilience has been posited as being psychologically protective for those living with SCD. This study examines changes in resilience over time in a SCD population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Ninety-seven adults living with SCD completed two parent studies: (1) The INSIGHTS Study, a cross-sectional natural history study conducted from 2014-2019 and (2) The Living with SCD in COVID-19 Pandemic Study, an online survey conducted in 2020. Changes over time in resilience, perceived stress, emotional distress, and physical and mental health were analyzed in multivariable repeated measures model. Results Results showed that the psychological resilience of our study cohort had significantly decreased (0.19, p=0.01) over time. Resilience during the pandemic was associated with better mental health and physical health and lower perceived stress and emotional distress.

Mental health difficulties were common with 38% and 20% of adolescents reporting clinically significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, and 21% reporting frequent suicidal or self-harm ideation. Factors associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms included being female, exposure to current maternal depressive symptoms, lower levels of resilience, experiences of loneliness, stressful life events, and school- and family-related stressors. Two-thirds of adolescents who were experiencing clinically significant depressive or anxiety symptoms had not sought professional help.

This potential might be realized, however, only if parents perceive the interventions as acceptable and therefore engage with treatment. Methods Parents (N = 124) of 3rd-5th grade students diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder rated the acceptability of their child's treatment (one of two culturally responsive behavioral interventions). Parent engagement was measured through attendance at parent training sessions and the extent to which they read a corresponding workbook. Results Education and income correlated inversely with parent perceptions of treatment acceptability. Acceptability correlated positively with engagement, more strongly among lower-income families.

To mitigate this potential bias, practitioners have relied on response time information to identify and filter RG responses. However, response times may be unavailable in many testing contexts, such as paper-and-pencil administrations. When this is the case, self-report measures of effort and person-fit statistics have been used. These methods are limited in that inferences concerning motivation and aberrant responding are made at the examinee level. As test takers can engage in a mixture of solution and RG behavior throughout a test administration, there is a need to limit the influence of potential aberrant responses at the item level. This can be done by employing robust estimation procedures. Since these estimators have received limited attention in the RG literature, the objective of this simulation study was to evaluate ability parameter estimation accuracy in the presence of RG by comparing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to two robust variants, the bisquare and Huber estimators.

ResultsAdolescents (53.1% F, 46.9% M) were a mean age of 17.1 years. A higher level of ED pathology was reported (12.1 vs. 5.3, p < .001) among adolescents who had a history of NSSI. Significantly higher levels of ED pathology were found among females who reported hitting themselves until bruised, head banging, severe scratching, and burning with a lighter, but not cutting, or the other forms of self-injury. Of adolescents with a history of NSSI, 60% of females and 15% of males scored above a cutoff for ED pathology.

This paradigm was devised to improve on the classical dot pattern task by ruling out any reliance on residual episodic memory or working memory resources. In the present study, we aimed to demonstrate: first, that people with even more severe episodic memory impairment than MCI are unimpaired on a fully implicit prototype learning task and second, that the dot pattern task, at variance with the FPLT, requires a no negligible contribution from the episodic memory system. Method: Twenty-four persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 48 healthy controls took part in this experiment. As in the original study, in addition to the FPLT, they were also administered the classical dot pattern task and an ordinary forced-choice face recognition task. Results: AD performed like normal controls in the FPLT but scored significantly worse on the dot pattern task and the face recognition task. Interestingly, although performance on the face recognition task did not correlate with that on the FPLT, a significant correlation was observed between the face recognition and the dot pattern task. Conclusions: Results support both of our claims: first, that also severe amnesic people can learn new visual prototypes with a fully implicit paradigm and, second, that the classical dot pattern task requires some degree of episodic resources.

It is thus well-known that lateral prism adaptation produces aftereffects on visuospatial representation and, recently, on auditory perception. This study aimed to explore the sensorimotor after-effects of vertical prism adaptation as well as its aftereffects on vertical visuospatial representation (Experiment 1) and on auditory frequency representation (Experiment 2). The experimental procedure was similar in both experiments: before and after prism adaptation to an upward or a downward optical deviation, healthy young participants performed an visual open-loop pointing task and a visual (Experiment 1) or an auditory (Experiment 2) perceptual bisection task. In the visual task, the participants had to indicate if they perceived the bisection as higher or lower than the true center of a line. In the auditory task, the participants had to indicate if they perceived the target auditory frequency closer to the low or the high limit of an auditory interval. For sensorimotor aftereffects, pointing errors were computed by means of a vertical touchscreen. For the perceptual bisection task, we measured the percentage of ""down"" (Experiment 1) or ""low"" responses (Experiment 2), and we computed the visual (Experiment 1) or the auditory (Experiment 2) subjective center for each participant. Statistical analyses were carried out separately for each optical deviation in each experiment. Sensorimotor aftereffects were observed in both experiments, in the opposite direction to the optical deviation (all ps < 0.01). No significant aftereffects occurred on visuospatial representation (all ps > 0.5), whereas the percentage of ""low"" responses and the auditory subjective center significantly increased after adaptation to a downward optical deviation (all ps < 0.05). Unlike lateral prism adaptation aftereffects that have been previously shown in both visuospatial horizontal representation and auditory frequency representation, aftereffects of vertical prism adaptation occurred in the auditory frequency representation but not in the vertical visuospatial representation. These results suggest that both vertical and lateral prism adaptations share a common substrate dedicated to the auditory modality (probably the temporal cortex), and that vertical adaptation does not act on the neural substrate of vertical visuospatial representation.",APR 26 2022,13,2022,2022-04-26,APR 26,Journal,Y,1664-1078,NA,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.850495,NA,MEDLINE:35558701,NA,NA,NA,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,Visuomanual Vertical Prism Adaptation: Aftereffects on Visuospatial and Auditory Frequency Representations,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

At baseline, higher levels of PTSD, depressive, and pain-related symptoms were associated with baseline global functional disability, semipartial r(2) (sr(2)) = .036-.044. Changes in symptoms of PTSD, depression, pain, and sleep, but not anxiety or alcohol use, were independently associated with changes in functional disability sr(2) = .017-.068. Baseline symptoms of these conditions were unrelated to changes in disability, and cognitive performance was unrelated to disability at any assessment point. Together, this suggests that changes in psychiatric and somatic symptoms are tightly linked with changes in functional disability and should be frequently monitored, and even subclinical symptoms may be a target of intervention.",JUN 2022,35,2022,2022-02-20,JUN,Journal,N,0894-9867,1573-6598,10.1002/jts.22809,NA,MEDLINE:35187726,NA,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF TRAUMATIC STRESS,Associations between changes in somatic and psychiatric symptoms and disability alterations in recent-era US veterans,J TRAUMA STRESS,J.

The study participants comprised 249 women who had engaged in five or more episodes of NSSI in the past 12 months. Among them, 67 had posted NSSI content online (NSSI Online), whereas 182 did not (NSSI Only). The two groups were compared using the MANCOVA analysis based on demographic data and clinical and psychosocial features. Additionally, Spearman's correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate potential risk factors associated with NSSI postings. Compared to the NSSI Only group, the NSSI Online group showed higher intrapersonal functions of NSSI, self-injury craving, suicidal ideation, and past suicide attempts, along with lower resilience and self-esteem. The clinical risk factor, suicidal ideation, was closely associated with the frequency of these postings.

We compared 38 NICHD interviews with 30 control interviews on variables such as the type of questions asked, number of reported words, and children's mood state. NICHD interviews contained more invitations and fewer suggestive questions compared to non-standardized interviews. Furthermore, children reported more information related to the reported incident when they were interviewed with the NICHD protocol compared to control interviews. After being interviewed, children reported a more positive mood state independent of how they were interviewed (NICHD or control interview).

Thus, greater binegativity was related to greater alcohol-related problems through greater drinking to cope motives and subsequent elevated alcohol consumption. Impulsivity significantly moderated the relation between drinking to cope motives and alcohol-related problems, whereby the positive association between drinking to cope motives and alcohol-related problems was stronger for those who reported greater impulsivity. Although binegativity and impulsivity were positively related, impulsivity did not moderate the associations between binegativity, drinking to cope motives, alcohol use, and alcohol-related problems.

Our analysis revealed the main effect of Script on both reading and orthographic learning: naming latencies during training were longer for the ambiguous stimuli, particularly for the novel ones. Nonetheless, novel word forms in the ambiguous condition approached the latencies for the familiar words along the exposures, although this effect was faster in the phonologically consistent trials. Post-training tests revealed similarly successful performance patterns for previously familiar and newly trained forms, indicating successful rapid acquisition of the latter. Furthermore, we found the highest free recall rates for the ambiguous stimuli.
