The intervention consisted of a reading strategy training conducted by teachers, in which 27 secondary-school classes (n(students) = 656) participated. The propensity-matched control group consisted of another 27 classes (n(students) = 558). Linear mixed models showed that students of the intervention classes had no greater gain in reading competence on average compared to students of the control classes. However, the groups differed regarding the learning gain at different achievement levels. In the control group, the gain was greatest for the low achievers and lowest for the high achievers. This imbalance was not found in the intervention group, where the learning gain was similar for students of each achievement level.

Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 14- to18-year-old healthy volunteers drawn from the general US population. We enrolled participants through a crowdsourcing platform (n = 1,093) and randomly assigned participants to one of three video conditions (117 s each): depressed (DEP); depressed, adjusted to aspects unique to being a Black adolescent girl (including experienced or internalized racism; ADJ); and control (CONT). The primary outcome was the Depression Stigma Scale (DSS); secondary outcomes were the General Health-Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ), and thermometers for Black and white race perception ""warmth"". Results Following the intervention, the DSS changed from baseline across the three conditions (p < .001). ADJ outperformed both DEP (p = .031) and CONT (p < .001). A race-by-intervention interaction (p < .001) revealed different response profiles between Black (ADJ = DEP = CONT; p = .726) and non-Black participants (ADJ > DEP > CONT; p < .001). DEP and ADJ both resulted in higher treatment-seeking intentions for both the emotional problems and the suicidal thought subscales of the GHSQ. We found a race-by-intervention interaction (p = .01) for the Black thermometer, which revealed a significant 2 degrees increase in warmth among white (p < .001), but not Black, viewers (p = .06). Conclusions On a short-term basis, brief social contact-based videos proved effective among adolescents in reducing depression-related stigma, increasing help-seeking intentions, and providing an ""empathic foothold"" in the lives of racially stigmatized groups.

This charitability did not reflect unconditional in-group favoritism. Instead, it was strongest for policy FFs-those meant to advance a party's explicit agenda-as opposed to personal FFs about a politician's past (Study 2) or electoral FFs that strayed from parties' explicit goals by aiming to disenfranchise legally eligible voters (Study 4). Although FFs can undermine general trustworthiness in the eyes of both in-group and out-group members, policy FFs in particular signal partisan trustworthiness (Studies 3-5)-the belief that a politician can be trusted by their own political side and not by the other.

Design Longitudinal, prospective observational study.
Methods Bariatric patients (n = 126, 77.8% female, 46.4 +/- 10.8 years) completed the Self-compassion Scale, Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale, Impact of Weight on Quality-of-Life questionnaire, Body Image Scale, Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire, Spinal Cord Injury Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale, and G-Food Craving Questionnaire pre-operatively and 12 months post-operatively. A medical professional measured patients' weight during each assessment. Data were analysed using repeated measures t-tests and multivariate regression analyses with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing.
Results Patients' BMI, depression, and food cravings decreased significantly after surgery while quality of life, body image satisfaction, and self-efficacy to exercise improved. Higher self-compassion was associated with lower post-operative depression, greater quality of life, higher body image satisfaction, and better self-efficacy for eating behaviours (p-values <.05) but not with post-operative BMI, self-efficacy to exercise, or food cravings.
Conclusions Even though pre-operative self-compassion was not directly associated with a lower 12-month post-operative BMI, it had a positive relationship with patients' post-operative well-being and self-efficacy for controlling eating behaviour.

To help build a joint understanding of foundational knowledge between the online learning, educational technology, and educational psychology communities, in this article, we summarize the most frequently cited conceptual model that shapes research and practice in the field of higher education online learning: the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework. We describe the original CoI model and its foundational components (i.e., cognitive, social, and teaching presence) and highlight opportunities for improvement of the model by incorporating the educational psychology and learning sciences research base to inform: (1) conceptualizations of the social dimensions of collaborative learning and (2) understanding of learner contributions to online collaborative education including self-, co-, and shared regulation of learning. We propose that a new, more comprehensive conceptualization of the regulation of collaborative online learning be integrated into the existing CoI framework and that a new ""presence"" be referenced going forward-""Learning Presence.""

Methods We revised a commonly used measure of social cognition, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), by expanding the instructions, using both self-completion and interviewer-completion versions (for illiterate respondents), and classifying each test administration as 'successfully completed' or 'incomplete'. The revised instrument (RMET-CV-R) was administered to 233 treatment-naive patients with chronic schizophrenia (UT), 154 treated controls with chronic schizophrenia (TC), and 259 healthy controls (HC) from rural communities in China. Results In bivariate and multivariate analyses, successful completion rates and RMET-CV-R scores (percent correct judgments about emotion exhibited in 70 presented slides) were highest in HC, intermediate in TC, and lowest in UT (adjusted completion rates, 97.0, 72.4, and 49.9%, respectively; adjusted RMET-CV-R scores, 45.4, 38.5, and 34.6%, respectively; all p < 0.02).

Conclusions We find poorer social cognition in treatment-naive than in treated patients with chronic schizophrenia.

Objective: To facilitate the translation of the potential anxiolytic mechanism of OT into clinical application, we determined whether the anxiolytic effects of OT are maintained with repeated (chronic) administration or are influenced by dose frequency and trait anxiety. Methods: In a pre-registered double-blind randomized placebo-controlled pharmaco-fMRI trial the acute (single dose) as well as chronic effects of two different dose frequencies of OT (OT administered daily for 5 days or every other day) on emotional reactivity were assessed in n = 147 individuals with high versus low trait anxiety (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03085654). Results: OT produced valence, dose frequency, and trait anxiety-specific effects, such that the low-frequency (intermittent) chronic dosage specifically attenuated a neural reactivity increase in amygdala-insula-prefrontal circuits observed in the high anxious placebo-treated subjects in response to threatening but not positive stimuli. Conclusions: The present trial provides the first evidence that low-dose frequency chronic intranasal OT has the potential to alleviate exaggerated neural threat reactivity in subjects with elevated anxiety levels, suggesting a treatment potential for anxiety disorders.",JUL 2022,91,2022,2022-01-27,JUL,Journal,N,0033-3190,1423-0348,10.1159/000521348,NA,MEDLINE:35086102,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOSOMATICS,Anxiolytic Effects of Chronic Intranasal Oxytocin on Neural Responses to Threat Are Dose-Frequency Dependent,PSYCHOTHER PSYCHOSOM,Psychother.

One such scale is the nine-item short-form Internet Disorder Scale (IDS9-SF) based on the DSM-5 criteria for internet gaming disorder. Although the IDS9-SF has been validated in a number of languages, it has not been validated into Italian.

They may do so even if they hold different desired work selves, engaging in interpersonal identity work. The processes of identity work and collective creation of an identity workspace are intertwined since the identity work of one individual is in an ongoing dynamic relation with the identity work of other individuals. People converge to play out their desired work selves in an identity workspace which is supportive. However, the heterogeneity of the desired work selves involved can lead to the individual's identity work encroaching on the identity work of the others, and this heterogeneity results in impasse.

Research has extensively demonstrated that it is pre/postdivorce family environment factors that primarily account for the variability in children's adaptation over parental divorce process rather than the legal divorce per se. Amongst various factors, interparental conflict has been consistently identified as a prominent one. Surprisingly, a single source is still lacking that comprehensively synthesizes the extant findings. This review fills this gap by integrating the numerous findings across studies into a more coherent Divorce Process and Child Adaptation Trajectory Typology (DPCATT) Model to illustrate that pre/postdivorce interparental conflict plays crucial roles in shaping child adaptation trajectories across parental divorce process. This review also summarizes the mechanisms (e.g., child cognitive and emotional processes, coparenting, parent-child relations) via which pre/postdivorce interparental conflict determines these trajectories and the factors (e.g., child gender and age, child coping, grandparental support) that interact with pre/postdivorce interparental conflict to further complicate these trajectories. In addition, echoing the call of moving beyond the monolithic conceptualization of pre/postdivorce interparental conflict, we also review studies on the differential implications of different aspects (e.g., frequency versus intensity) and types (e.g., overt versus covert) of interparental conflict for child adjustment. Last, limitations of prior studies and avenues for future research are discussed.

To make this less likely, we test in two experiments (N = 1,879) a strategy to reduce subordinates' endorsement of sexist supervisors. We do this by encouraging 4 subordinates to see themselves as low in perceived professional prototype alignment (PPPA)-the extent to which a subordinate perceives their supervisor to share their beliefs about what it means to be a member of their profession-with sexist supervisors. Specifically, encouraging subordinates' to hold less masculine, more ""balanced"" professional prototypes, in which they see stereotypically feminine attributes as equally important to the job as stereotypically masculine ones, reduces PPPA with sexist supervisors.

Methods: Focus group discussions were conducted with 26 students in grades 6-8 to understand student perspectives about an innovative school-based SBIRT program. A subset of middle school students from the SBIRT program who received a brief intervention (BI) after screening (n = 116) were asked to rate their experience meeting with the interventionist in terms of feeling comfortable, feeling listened to, and talking about their goals. Additionally, these students' ratings of connection to adults at school was compared from the time of screening (baseline) to following BI using two-sided paired t-tests.
Results: Students who participated in focus groups expressed favorable opinions about universal screening and this school-based SBIRT model and noted that relationship building with adults at school was an important factor for open communication and motivating behavior change for students. Nearly all students who completed the post-BI survey rated their experiences with interventionists during BI as ""Excellent,"" ""Very Good,"" or ""Good"" in all categories (98%). Students' reported mean school connection scores significantly higher after participation in school-based SBIRT than at baseline (5.9/8 vs. 7.0/8, p < .001).
Discussion: Middle school students were satisfied with the school-based SBIRT model and participation in the program resulted in increased student connection with adults at school. These findings improve our understanding of the experience of SBIRT intervention with middle school students and on school connection in particular.

However, emerging evidence suggests that the active-passive distinction is too coarse to fully capture the relationship between SNS use and well-being.

This includes impaired inhibitory control over inappropriate responses. Prior studies showed that inhibitory control can be improved by modulating the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in combination with inhibitory control training. However, its clinical potential remains unclear. We therefore aimed to replicate a tDCS-enhanced inhibitory control training in a clinical sample and test whether this reduces stress-related mental health symptoms. Methods In a preregistered double-blind randomized-controlled trial, 100 active-duty military personnel and post-active veterans with PTSD, anxiety, or impulsive aggression symptoms underwent a 5-session intervention where a stop-signal response inhibition training was combined with anodal tDCS over the right IFG for 20 min at 1.25 mA. Inhibitory control was evaluated with the emotional go/no-go task and implicit association test. Stress-related symptoms were assessed by self-report at baseline, post-intervention, and after 3-months and 1-year follow-ups. Results Active relative to sham tDCS neither influenced performance during inhibitory control training nor on assessment tasks, and did also not significantly influence self-reported symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, impulsive aggression, or depression at post-assessment or follow-up. Conclusions Our results do not support the idea that anodal tDCS over the right IFG at 1.25 mA enhances response inhibition training in a clinical sample, or that this tDCS-training combination can reduce stress-related symptoms. Applying different tDCS parameters or combining tDCS with more challenging tasks might provide better conditions to modulate cognitive functioning and stress-related symptoms.",DEC 2022,52,2022,2021-03-24,DEC,Journal,N,0033-2917,1469-8978,10.1017/S0033291721000817,NA,MEDLINE:33757606,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,"Effects of tDCS during inhibitory control training on performance and PTSD, aggression and anxiety symptoms: a randomized-controlled trial in a military sample",PSYCHOL MED,Psychol.

Black and Hispanic students are more likely to be over-policed in schools and to be penalized, especially by White teachers. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) skills can be taught to educators to support antiracist efforts in schools.Method: A virtual 2-day Train-the-Trainer antiracism workshop incorporating DBT skills was delivered to South Texas educators. DBT skills were integrated as life skills in antiracism situational role play, small group discussions, and meta-cognitive activities. Participants also received books on antiracism and an educators' toolkit to DBT and antiracism. Descriptive analysis described results from the workshop application, pre/post-workshop survey, and 6-month follow-up survey.Results: Twelve educators completed the workshop application, with 10 educators reporting no history of antiracism trainings at their schools. Nine educators attended the workshop. Workshop feedback was overwhelmingly positive. A pre/post-workshop survey demonstrated growth in both teaching and use of all measured DBT skills and antiracism attitudes. Confidence in teaching and using DBT skills and changes in antiracism attitudes were sustained 6 months later. Five educators reported leading an antiracism initiative in their schools since the attendance of the workshop.Conclusion: A DBT-centered Train-the-Trainer antiracism workshop instilled confidence in educators to lead antiracism efforts, which resulted in the initiation of several initiatives in South Texas schools.

Data came from the EDEN mother-child cohort. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI status (kg/m(2)) was calculated using pre-pregnancy weight and height (self-reported by mothers or measured by midwives). HIS were assessed by parental-report on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at 3, 5 and 8 years of age and used to derive developmental trajectories of HIS (n = 1428). Multivariate models were adjusted for confounders including socioeconomic status, maternal lifestyle behaviours (exercise, diet, smoking, alcohol), childcare and a stimulating home environment. Paternal BMI was used as a negative control. Compared to a normal pre-pregnancy BMI, pre-pregnancy maternal obesity was positively associated with increased odds of a high HIS trajectory between 3 and 8 years old in both unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.87 [95% CI 1.12, 3.12]). Pre-pregnancy overweight was not significantly associated after adjustment for confounders (aOR 1.32 [0.87, 2.01]).

Method: We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA), including data of randomized controlled behavioral intervention trials for individuals with ADHD <18 years of age. Outcomes were symptoms of ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD) and impairment. Moderators investigated were symptoms and impairment severity, medication use, age, IQ, sex, socioeconomic status, and single parenthood.
Results: For raters most proximal to treatment, small- to medium-sized effects of behavioral interventions were found for symptoms of ADHD, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI), ODD and CD, and impairment. Blinded outcomes were available only for small preschool subsamples and limited measures. CD symptoms and/or diagnosis moderated outcome on ADHD, HI, ODD, and CD symptoms. Single parenthood moderated ODD outcome, and ADHD severity moderated impairment outcome. Higher baseline CD or ADHD symptoms, a CD diagnosis, and single parenthood were related to worsening of symptoms in the untreated but not in the treated group, indicating a protective rather than an ameliorative effect of behavioral interventions for these children.
Conclusion: Behavioral treatments are effective for reducing ADHD symptoms, behavioral problems, and impairment as reported by raters most proximal to treatment.

Personality traits, such as neuroticism and conscientiousness, have long-term predictive power for cognitive impairment in older adulthood, a critical health outcome. Less is known about whether personality measured earlier in life is also associated with cognition across adulthood prior to dementia. Methods Using data from the British Cohort Study 1970 (N = 4218; 58% female), the current research examined the relation between self-reported and mother-rated personality at age 16 and cognitive function concurrently at age 16 and cognitive function measured 30 years later at age 46, and whether these traits mediate the relation between childhood social class and midlife cognition. Results Self-reported and mother-rated conscientiousness at age 16 were each associated with every cognitive measure at age 16 and most measures at age 46. Self-reported openness was likewise associated with better cognitive performance on all tasks at age 16 and prospectively predicted age 46 performance (mothers did not rate openness). Mother-rated agreeableness, but not self-reported, was associated with better cognitive performance at both time points. Adolescent personality mediated the relation between childhood social class and midlife cognitive function. Conclusions The current study advances personality and cognition by showing that (1) adolescent personality predicts midlife cognition 30 years later, (2) both self-reports and mother-ratings are important sources of information on personality associated with midlife cognition, and (3) adolescent personality may be one pathway through which the early life socioeconomic environment is associated with midlife cognition.",DEC 2022,52,2022,2021-03-12,DEC,Journal,N,0033-2917,1469-8978,10.1017/S0033291721000672,NA,MEDLINE:33706817,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,Self-reported and mother-rated personality traits at age 16 are associated with cognitive function measured concurrently and 30 years later,PSYCHOL MED,Psychol.

This is the first prospective study of associations between repeated, device-based measures of sedentary behaviour and anxiety symptoms in adolescents. MethodsA UK cohort with 4257 adolescents aged 12 at baseline (56% female). Main exposures were sedentary behaviour and physical activity measured using accelerometers for 7-days at ages 12, 14, and 16. Primary outcome was anxiety symptom scores at age 18 from a Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised. We used adjusted negative binomial regression and iso-temporal substitution methods to analyse the data. ResultsWe found a positive association between sedentary behaviour at ages 12, 14, and 16, with anxiety symptoms at age 18, independent of total physical activity volume. Theoretically replacing an hour of daily sedentary behaviour for light activity at ages 12, 14, and 16, was associated with lower anxiety symptoms by age 18 by 15.9% (95% CI 8.7-22.4), 12.1% (95% CI 3.4-20.1), and 14.7% (95% CI 4-24.2), respectively. Whereas, theoretically replacing an hour of sedentary behaviour with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was not associated with differences in anxiety symptoms. These results were robust to a series of sensitivity analyses.

Yet it is unclear by which mechanisms these associations arise. Here, we explored a possible gene-environment correlation in the association of schizophrenia polygenic risk with mental health problems via childhood adversity. This study was embedded in the population-based Generation R Study, including N = 1901 participants with genotyping for schizophrenia polygenic risk, maternal reporting of childhood adversity, and Child Behaviour Checklist measurement of mental health problems. Independent replication was attempted in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; N = 3641). Associations were analysed with Poisson regression and statistical mediation analysis. Higher burden of schizophrenia polygenic risk was associated with greater exposure to childhood adversity (P-value threshold < 0.5: Generation R Study, OR = 1.08, 95%CI 1.02-1.15, P = 0.01; ALSPAC, OR = 1.02, 95%CI 1.01-1.03, P < 0.01). Childhood adversities partly explained the relationship of schizophrenia polygenic risk with emotional, attention, and thought problems (proportion explained, range 5-23%). Direct effects of schizophrenia polygenic risk and adversity on mental health outcomes were also observed. In summary, genetic liability to schizophrenia increased the risk for mental health problems in the general paediatric population through childhood adversity. Although this finding could result from a mediated causal relationship between genotype and mental health, we argue that these observations most likely reflect a gene-environment correlation, i.e. adversities are a marker for the genetic risk that parents transmit to children.

Methods Fifty-three probands with ADHD, their unaffected siblings (n = 53) and typically developing controls (n = 53) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. A seed-based approach with the bilateral precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) was used to derive a whole-brain functional connectivity map in each subject. The differences in functional connectivity among the three groups were tested with one-way ANOVA using randomized permutation. Comparisons between two groups were also performed to examine the increase or decrease in connectivity. The severity of ADHD symptoms was used to identify brain regions where symptom severity is correlated to the strength of intrinsic functional connectivity. Results When compared to controls, both probands and unaffected siblings showed increased functional connectivity in the left insula and left inferior frontal gyrus. The connectivity in these regions was linked to better performance in response inhibition in the control group but absent in other groups. Higher ADHD symptom severity was correlated with increased functional connectivity in bilateral fronto-parietal-temporal regions only noted in probands with ADHD. Conclusions Alterations in resting-state functional connectivities with the precuneus/PCC, hubs of default-mode network, account for the underlying familial risks of ADHD.

Accordingly, the proposed method allows us to conduct power analysis for mixed-effects modeling using popular software such as G*Power or the pwr package in R and, with minimum input from relevant prior work (e.g., t value). We provide analytic proof and a series of statistical simulations to show the validity and robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis and show illustrative examples with real published work.

Translational Abstract
For applied researchers, statistical power analysis with mixed-effects modeling (or multilevel modeling) poses a big challenge, because it requires substantive expertise on modeling, use of special software, and a number of input parameters which are usually not available in published work. In fact, despite the number of research articles on this topic, we found that applied researchers rarely use appropriate statistical power analysis recommended by experts. To improve the current state of practice, this article proposes an easy and practical method to conduct statistical power analysis for mixed-effects modeling, called summary-statistics-based power analysis. While the proposed method has limited flexibilities (e.g., it can be applied only to two-level nested data), it has greater advantages over traditional power-analysis methods (formula- and simulation-based power analyses) in terms of usability and practicality. In fact, the proposed method can determine appropriate Level-2 sample size of a new study by using only a t value and Level-2 sample size from a previous study. Moreover, the sample size calculation can be easily conducted using popular software such as G*Power or the pwr package in R. A series of statistical simulations demonstrate the validity and robustness of the summary-statistics-based power analysis. We also provide illustrative examples with real published work. To further ease the demand for applied researchers, we developed a web app (https://koumurayama.shinyapps.io/summary_statistics_based_power/)) that automatically performs the proposed method.",DEC 2022,27,2022,2022-01-31,DEC,Journal,N,1082-989X,1939-1463,10.1037/met0000330,NA,MEDLINE:35099237,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS,Summary-Statistics-Based Power Analysis: A New and Practical Method to Determine Sample Size for Mixed-Effects Modeling,PSYCHOL METHODS,Psychol.

In 1942, Shaw and McKay reported that disadvantaged neighborhoods predict youth psychopathology (Shaw & McKay, 1942). In the decades since, dozens of papers have confirmed and extended these early results, convincingly demonstrating that disadvantaged neighborhood contexts predict elevated rates of both internalizing and externalizing disorders across childhood and adolescence. It is unclear, however, how neighborhood disadvantage increases psychopathology.
Methods. Our study sought to fill this gap in the literature by examining the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a composite measure of Census tract disadvantage, as an etiologic moderator of several common forms of psychopathology in two samples of school-aged twins from the Michigan State University Twin Registry (N = 4815 and 1030 twin pairs, respectively), the latter of which was enriched for neighborhood disadvantage.
Results. Across both samples, genetic influences on attention-deficit hyperactivity problems were accentuated in the presence of marked disadvantage, while nonshared environmental contributions to callous-unemotional traits increased with increasing disadvantage. However, neighborhood disadvantage had little moderating effect on the etiology of depression, anxiety, or somatic symptoms.
Conclusions. Such findings suggest that, although neighborhood disadvantage does appear to serve as a general etiologic moderator of many (but not all) forms of psychopathology, this etiologic moderation is phenotype-specific.",MAY 2023,53,2023,2022-02-16,MAY,Journal,N,0033-2917,1469-8978,10.1017/S0033291721005080,NA,MEDLINE:35168691,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,Understanding the effects of neighborhood disadvantage on youth psychopathology,PSYCHOL MED,Psychol.

This study proposes and tests a dynamic activation hypothesis using theory elaboration, combining construct specification (clarifying the nature of activation as fluctuations in self-efficacy), vertical contrasting (distinguishing between- and within-person effects), and structuring (proposing recursive relationships). Hypotheses were tested in three-wave data (1755 teachers), analyzed using random intercept cross-lagged panel analyses. The results differed at the between- and within-person level. A baseline level of autonomy appeared essential (between-level), but increases in autonomy over time do not predict increased self-efficacy (within-level). High baseline levels of workload are negatively related to self-efficacy (between-level), but modest increases in workload backed-up with added autonomy are related to increased self-efficacy (within-level). In turn, increases in self-efficacy stimulate workload. This hints at a feedback loop, which is balanced by a negative feedback process.

Method: Structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of IPV survivors, 93% of whom identified as women, living in a rural parish (county) in Louisiana (n = 41). Interviews included COVID-19-related stressors (e.g., rent stress due to the pandemic) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5) and resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10) validated scales. Data were analyzed using independent t tests to determine differences across race with respect to PTSD and resilience and logistic regression to predict group membership in the probable PTSD group. Results: Results indicate 72.5% and 56.2% of rural IPV survivors interviewed reported experiencing rent/mortgage stress and nutritional stress, respectively, due to the pandemic. No statistically significant differences by race for probable PTSD or resilience were found. Rent or mortgage stress due to COVID-19 was a significant predictor of probable PTSD in the regression model. Conclusions: Findings suggest the possibility that IPV concerns may exacerbate pandemic-related concerns, which in turn exacerbates health functioning.

SI DEC 2022,Life Sciences & Biomedicine,NA,"Psychology, Developmental",Rehabilitation,"Psychology,Rehabilitation",Social Sciences,Science & Technology,"Background: Little research addresses the experiences of autistic people at work, yet employment prospects remain bleak. The extant literature takes a largely remedial perspective and does not focus on harnessing this population's considerable talents. In global organizational practice, several programs purposefully target autistic people for their abilities. However, preliminary evidence suggests that such programs are inadvertently attracting mainly White males, to the exclusion of other demographics. Therefore, stigma surrounding autism at work remains, creating potential compound adverse impacts by marginalizing identities, including gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. We explored the intersection of autism with other marginalizing identities in the context of work. The research focused on labor force participation for autistic people and, for those in employment, perceptions of exclusion and inclusion. We compared the aforementioned variables by gender identity, racial identity, sexuality, socioeconomic background, and geographic origin.Methods: We undertook a global cross-sectional survey, advertised through various social media platforms and promoted directly to relevant organizations. The survey included a range of validated measures as well as demographic information. We analyzed the data with frequencies, cross tabulations, chi-square tests, and non-parametric, group-wise comparisons.Results: We found preliminary evidence of reduced rates of employment participation by race and geographic location. Females and non-binary people had lower perceptions of inclusion and belonging at work. The perception of accommodation provision had a strong association with inclusion and belonging; more so than incidental provision of flexibility in environment and scheduling not framed as a specific accommodation.Conclusions: The findings highlight the relational aspects of accommodation and a more universal inclusion perspective. We urge practitioners and researchers to monitor employment participation and levels of inclusion/exclusion using intersectional demographic identification. We appeal for cross-cultural collaboration with academic institutions outside the anglosphere to improve our knowledge of global programs and their impact.
Community brief Why is this an important issue?Employment data show that autistic people find it harder to get and keep work. This study focuses on understanding whether multiple identities and people's background make a difference. What is the purpose of this study?We asked a group of Autistic people about gender and race, as well as being gay lesbian, bisexual, transgender or queer (LGBTQ). We asked where people live, their education, parents' education and whether they had any diagnoses in addition to autism. We predicted that these things would have a negative effect on autistic employment rates. We thought they would also affect how autistic people felt at work. What we did?An online survey was completed by 576 autistic people. We analyzed whether their identities and backgrounds made it more or less likely that they were in work. We then asked the 387 employed people within this group about their experiences at work. We compared their experiences by identity and background to see whether these made a positive or negative difference. What we found?We found that White Autistic people living in western countries such as the United States and Europe were more likely to have jobs. They were also more likely to have jobs specifically designed for Autistic people. We found that women, non-binary, and transgender autistic people felt less included at work. We also found that feeling that someone cares is more important than any adjustments to work scheduling such as flexible working to support people. What do these findings add to what was already known?It is already known that autistic people are less likely to be in work than non-autistic people. This study shows that these overall numbers are masking important differences arising from gender, race, and ethnicity. What are the potential weaknesses in the study?The survey was taken at one point in time, which does not explain how these differences happened. Most people who completed the study were highly educated. We did not have enough people from the non-western countries or communities of color. Therefore, the sample is not large or diverse enough to draw firm conclusions. How will the study help Autistic people now or in the future?We hope that the study inspires people to think about different identities and additional stigma for autism at work programs. We have provided a sample of baseline data from all over the world that shows a difference by location. Even though this is just a trend, it might spark more research looking at the crossover between autism, identities, and backgrounds. It provides a starting point to help researchers who want to do longer studies that test interventions to improve autistic participation and experiences in work.",DEC 2022,4,2022,2022-11-16,DEC,Journal,N,2573-9581,2573-959X,10.1089/aut.2021.0082,NA,MEDLINE:36777372,NA,NA,NA,AUTISM IN ADULTHOOD,Intersectional Stigma for Autistic People at Work: A Compound Adverse Impact Effect on Labor Force Participation and Experiences of Belonging,AUTISM ADULTHOOD,Autism Adulthood,AUTISM ADUL,AUTISM ADULTHOOD,1,publisher,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",1,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",AUTISM IN ADULTHOOD

In the present studies, we investigate the nature, structure, and nomological network of left-wing authoritarianism (LWA), a construct famously known as ""the Loch Ness Monster"" of political psychology. We iteratively construct a measure and data-driven conceptualization of LWA across six samples (N = 7,258) and conduct quantitative tests of LWA's relations with more than 60 authoritarianism-related variables. We find that LWA, right-wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation reflect a shared constellation of personality traits, cognitive features, beliefs, and motivational values that might be considered the ""heart"" of authoritarianism. Relative to right-wing authoritarians, left-wing authoritarians were lower in dogmatism and cognitive rigidity, higher in negative emotionality, and expressed stronger support for a political system with substantial centralized state control. Our results also indicate that LWA powerfully predicts behavioral aggression and is strongly correlated with participation in political violence.

We investigated the relationship between traumatic stress and academic outcomes by gender among predominantly minoritized students, and whether resilience-building assets can mediate the relationship between traumatic stress and academic outcomes. Method: School administrative data were linked to survey data from 9th graders in 2016-2018 across 37 West Coast schools. We examined the association between traumatic stress risk and academic outcomes by gender. Where significant associations were found, mixed effects regression models accounting for school-level variation were fit to assess the role of resilience-building assets as potential mediators of the relationship between traumatic stress risk and academic outcomes. Results: Among 1,750 female and 2,036 male students, we found no significant association between traumatic stress risk and low attendance (<96% days attended). The odds of low grade point average (GPA <2.0) were significantly higher among female students with traumatic stress risk (OR = 1.46, 95% CI [1.16, 1.84]), with no association among males. In models controlling for resilience-building assets, the magnitude of the association between traumatic stress risk and GPA <2.0 among females was reduced. We identified significant mediation for 3 resilience measures: self-efficacy (21.20%; p < .05), school support (18.97%; p < .05), and total internal assets (27.84%; p < .01). Conclusions: Resilience-building assets may partially mediate the effect of traumatic stress on GPA among females. Resilience initiatives, especially among minoritized female students, may protect against the effect of trauma on academics.
Clinical Impact Statement From a sample of minoritized 9th grade students from a large school district, we found that the odds of having a low GPA were significantly higher among female students with traumatic stress risk; however, we found no association among males. We found that the association between traumatic stress and GPA among female students may be partially explained by several resilience characteristics. It may be helpful for schools-and clinicians working within schools-to focus on bolstering resilience-building assets, including from whole school approaches to resilience-building interventions, among minoritized female students, to help reduce the impact of traumatic stress on academics.",APR 2022,14,2022,2022-01-06,APR,Journal,N,1942-9681,1942-969X,10.1037/tra0001161,NA,MEDLINE:34990149,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY,"The Role of Resilience and Gender: Understanding the Relationship Between Risk for Traumatic Stress, Resilience, and Academic Outcomes Among Minoritized Youth",PSYCHOL TRAUMA-US,Psychol.

Additional studies establish a mechanism for this effect, whereby negotiators who use extended silence show evidence of greater deliberative mindset (Study 3) and a reduction in fixed-pie perceptions (Study 4), both of which are associated with value creation. Taken together, our findings are consistent with the internal reflection perspective, whereby extended silence increases value creation by interrupting default, fixed-pie thinking, and fostering a more deliberative mindset. Findings of Study 3 also suggest a boundary condition whereby when status differences are salient, the use of silence by higher status parties leads to value creation, whereas the use of silence by lower status parties does not.

To address this question, we contend that scholars need to understand how leaders-the perpetrators of these actions-make sense of abusive supervision. Specifically, drawing upon theories of appraisal and attribution, this paper examines leaders' cognitions of who is accountable for incidents of abusive supervision (i.e., the leader or the subordinate) and their future expectations (i.e., are individuals likely to engage in the same behaviors subsequently or are capable of change) and how these appraisals interact to shape emotional reactions. We conducted three complementary studies: a pilot study to identify relevant emotions, an event-based experience sampling study (Study 1), and a retrospective recall study (Study 2). Accountability appraisals were associated with emotions, such that appraisals that oneself (vs. one's subordinate) was more responsible for the incident were linked to higher levels of guilt and shame. Although growth mindset moderated associations between accountability appraisals and emotions, it did so for different emotions across the two studies (i.e., hostility in Study 1 and shame in Study 2).

Nevertheless, little research has been conducted in this area. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential buffering effect of the 2 types of social capital-bonding and bridging social capital-on the association between severity of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a large sample of earthquake survivors in Iran. Method: Participants were 600 adults who survived the Azarbaijan earthquake in Iran. Participants were selected using a multistage sampling method. PTSD symptoms were reported in 37% of the participants, 95% CI [34%, 41%]. Results: Consistent with prior research, significant differences were found between areas that were highly affected and areas that were less affected by the disaster. Although both bonding and bridging social capitals were negatively related to PTSD symptoms, this buffering effect against PTSD symptoms was about 2 times as large for bridging capital than for bonding social capital. Conclusion: While bridging and bonding social capital are both significant protective factors for mental health outcomes following natural disasters, bridging social capital may be more important. Future directions for this area of research are discussed, as are policy implications for disaster preparedness and postdisaster interventions.
Clinical Impact Statement In this article, we examine the potential buffering role of bridging and bonding social capital in the development of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms following exposure to a natural disaster. Although both types of social capital had a buffering effect, bridging social capital had a particularly strong effect.

Across three studies we examined the connections between desire for an identity and consumption experience. In Study 1, participants rated products as tastier the more they desired the associated identities.

Alexithymia, or difficulty identifying and describing emotions, may be playing an important role. The present study examined contributions of alexithymia and childhood maltreatment as related to somatic symptoms. Method: Participants (N = 447) completed measures of childhood maltreatment, alexithymia, and somatic symptoms. Two three-step hierarchical linear regressions were conducted to examine the unique contribution of alexithymia after accounting for demographic characteristics and childhood maltreatment. The first regression utilized total scores, and the second explored five domains of childhood maltreatment, a trauma validity index, and three domains of alexithymia. Results: In the first linear regression, childhood maltreatment and alexithymia were significantly associated with higher somatic symptoms. In the second linear regression, childhood maltreatment and alexithymia both significantly added to the model; however, only emotional abuse was significantly associated with somatic symptoms. Conclusions: In line with previous research, childhood maltreatment and alexithymia are associated with somatic symptoms. Given specific domains of alexithymia were nonsignificant in this relationship, it appears no single aspect of alexithymia is of greater importance. Future research should examine these associations longitudinally, as improving alexithymia may help improve outcomes in individuals with childhood maltreatment history experiencing somatic symptoms.
Clinical Impact Statement Many individuals who have experienced childhood maltreatment report somatic symptoms. Both have been associated with alexithymia, the inability to identify or describe emotions. Understanding which types of maltreatment or alexithymia contribute most to somatic symptoms is less clear.

First, the strength of this association is postulated to be enhanced in men, especially following status losses inflicted by other men (intra-male status losses). Second, given the evolutionary postulated relationship between social status and physical fitness, sensitivity to status loss in SA is expected to extend to physically threatening events. We examined these predictions in four online samples (total N = 1123; 59% females, 27% above the cutoff for clinically elevated SA). In all studies, participants recalled social status-loss events and rated the emotional and distressing impact of these experiences. In two samples, participants also identified and recalled physically threatening events. Our findings were consistent with evolutionary predictions.

However, smartphone addiction may also intensify negative emotion (e.g., fear of missing out, anxiety, and depression) and risky behavior (e.g., excessive social media use and problematic smartphone game activities). To date, few studies have adopted a network analysis approach to investigate the reciprocal action between the aforementioned variables. Therefore, the present study used network analysis to evaluate the relationship between FoMO, SNS use, and smartphone addiction among a sample of Chinese university students.
Methods: A sample comprising 1258 Chinese university students (502 males) completed a survey including the Chinese Trait-State Fear of Missing Out Scale (T-SFoMOSC), Mobile Phone Addiction Index (MPAI), and Social Network Site Intensity Scale (SNSIS).
Results: Inability to control craving and productivity loss had the closest edge intensity. Feeling anxious and lost was the strongest central node (betweenness = 1.903, closeness = 1.853, strength = 1.287) in the domain-level network. The item-level network analysis showed that FoMO was positively associated with SNS use and smartphone addiction. There were no significant gender differences in the network structure and the global edge strength.
Conclusions: The findings here indicate that there is a close relationship between FoMO, SNS use, and smartphone addiction. Excessive social media use and higher level of FoMO appear to play a contributory role in smartphone addiction. Smartphone addiction may also further increase excessive SNS use and increase the level of FoMO. A bidirectional influence between smartphone addiction, SNS use and FOMO should be considered.

To assess this relationship, we use a sample of 42,204 adolescents (ages 12-17 years) in the United States whose caregivers were surveyed during the three most recent cohorts (2016-2018) of the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH).

Findings also indicated that associations were of a greater magnitude among youth who are not sports-involved. Supplemental mediation analyses showed that ADHD and conduct problems attenuated associations between ACE exposure and TBI, but only in the absence of youth sports involvement.

Although catch-up growth after growth delay may result in developmental gains, it may also present as a double-edged sword, with consequences for neurocognitive functioning such as symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity. As previously institutionalized (PI) children experience height delays at adoption and catch-up growth after adoption, they provide a cohort to test associations between catch-up growth and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Methods This study used latent growth curve modeling to examine how catch-up in height-for-age growth is related to attention problems in a population of PI youth followed from adoption in infancy through kindergarten. Participants were assessed within three months of arrival into their families (age at entry: 18-36 months). Anthropometrics were measured four times, approximately 7 months apart. Two visits measured behavioral outcomes with parent and teacher reports of ADHD, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms at age 5 and kindergarten. Results The slope of growth in height z-scores, but not the intercept, was positively associated with parent- and teacher-reported ADHD symptoms in children. A one standard deviation increase in the slope of height z-scores across four assessments was associated with a 0.252 standard deviation increase in ADHD symptoms after controlling for internalizing and externalizing problems, iron status, duration of institutional care, sex, and age. The slope of growth was also associated with internalizing but not externalizing symptoms. Conclusions This study demonstrates that PI children exhibit individual trajectories of height growth postadoption. Higher rates of change in height-for-age growth were associated with increased ADHD symptoms. These results suggest that catch-up growth comes 'at the cost' of poor attention regulation and hyperactive behavior.",NOV 2022,63,2022,2022-03-06,NOV,Journal,N,0021-9630,1469-7610,10.1111/jcpp.13594,NA,MEDLINE:35253222,NA,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY,Does rapid rebound height growth come at a neurocognitive cost for previously institutionalized youth?,J CHILD PSYCHOL PSYC,J.

Social connection is a fundamental human need, yet researchers still possess few tools to effectively and durably boost it. MDMA allows investigators to isolate the psychological mechanisms-as well as brain pathways-underlying felt social connection and thus reveal what should be targeted in future (nondrug) studies. Accordingly, I introduce a conceptual model that presents the proximal psychological mechanisms stimulated by MDMA (lowered fear, increased sociability, more chemistry), as well as its potential long-term impacts (improved relationships, reduced loneliness, stronger therapeutic alliances). Finally, I discuss further questions (e.g., whether using MDMA for enhancing connection can backfire) and promising research areas for building a new science of psychedelic social psychology.

We further propose that change in future work self salience influences job search success through engagement in more effective job search behaviors. Results from a three-wave, three-month longitudinal survey of 539 undergraduate business school job seekers indicated that when they exercised higher levels of motivation control, their future work selves grew more salient. Further, as job seekers' future work selves became more salient, they conducted a more intense job search and used more focused and exploratory job search strategies.

However, evidence from general population samples is scarce. Moreover, whether decision-making is prospectively linked to mental health in youth in the general population and whether such associations are reciprocal have yet to be examined. The present study examined bidirectional associations between various aspects of affective decision-making and emotional and behavioural problems at ages 11 and 14 years in 13,366 members of the Millennium Cohort Study. Decision-making (delay aversion, deliberation time, quality of decision-making, risk adjustment, risk-taking) and emotional (emotional symptoms, peer problems) and behavioural (conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention) problems were measured using the Cambridge Gambling Task and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, respectively. Results of cross-lagged panel models adjusted for confounding revealed a negative reciprocal association between hyperactivity and quality of decision-making but also positive reciprocal associations between conduct problems and delay aversion, and between peer problems and deliberation time. Emotional problems and peer problems predicted a decrease in risk-taking, conduct problems predicted an increase in risk-taking, and hyperactivity predicted an increase in delay aversion and deliberation time.

The results suggest that behavioural problems are prospectively linked to greater risk-taking and lower risk adjustment in adolescence.

The objective of this study is to explore the beliefs and attitudes about MOUD among young adults.Methods: We conducted a single-site qualitative study of 20 young adults ages 18-29 years with a diagnosis of OUD receiving care at an outpatient program and who spoke English. We used a flexible interview guide with the following domains: experience with MOUD, sources and impact of stigma, and interactions with family, healthcare professionals, and social networks. We conducted a thematic analysis based on deductive codes related to the domains and emergent codes from the interviews.Results: We identified three themes. First, participants perceived being on MOUD as stigmatizing. They regarded MOUD as lifesaving but ultimately as a ""crutch"" hindering their full recovery. Second, young adults expressed ambivalence, distinct from stigma, about MOUD. This ambivalence was related to fear of withdrawal symptoms and concerns about their ability to live independent lives, side effects, and unknown treatment duration. Third, participants felt that MOUD was more than just a means to reduce risk of overdose, it was a means to become fully functioning in their lives. Discussion: In this study of young adults in treatment for OUD, we found that stigma and ambivalence concerning MOUD could explain young adults' low engagement in care. Interventions addressing concerns about the stigmatizing effects of MOUD and the ambivalence young adults experience related to MOUD could improve engagement and retention of young adults.(c) 2022 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

BI is among the earliest and strongest predictors of future anxiety problems. However, not all children with a history of BI will manifest anxiety problems. A growing body of evidence suggests that proactive control skills may help buffer youth with BI from future anxiety difficulties; yet, it remains unclear how temperament may interact with the development of cognitive control to influence anxiety risk. The present study tested whether enhancements in proactive control occurring during adolescence may reduce risk for anxiety among youth with a history of BI.Method: Participants included 185 adolescents (56% female) whose temperament was assessed during toddlerhood. In adolescence, participants completed anxiety assessments and an AX Continuous Performance Test (AX-CPT) to assess cognitive control strategy. Both assessments were administered at age 13 years and again at 15 years.Results: Latent change score modeling revealed that, on average, participants increasingly used proactive control strategies and experienced worsening anxiety from age 13-15 years. Early BI was associated with a smaller anxiety increase from 13-15 years, but only among participants whose proactive control skills improved at mean or greater rates.Conclusion: The present findings suggest that greater proactive control development during adolescence protects youth with high BI from age-related increases in anxiety.

However, there are reasons to wonder about the accuracy of such questionnaire-based estimates.

Here, we explored various social elements that may be associated with spatial orientation abilities to better understand which aspects of social life may help with organizing a social cognitive map (i.e. a mental representation of social information organized in an orderly and hierar-chical manner). To this aim, we assessed social capital, social competence, and quality of social support in a large group of healthy individuals, and analyzed their relationship with performance on spatial orientation tasks evaluating the ability to form and make use of spatial cognitive maps. The findings revealed that individuals who had more social competence, social capital, and social support, perceived themselves to be better at spatially navigating within the environment, as documented in a self-reported measure of spatial navigation in daily life. However, their performance on spatial orientation tasks in a virtual environment revealed that they were instead significantly poor at spatially navigating.

Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between frailty and sample demographics (age, female sex, and non-Caucasian ethnicity) and clinical characteristics (dementia, number of clinical diseases, current infection, number of psychotropic, and non-psychotropic medications in use). Multiple regression between frailty assessments and either falls or number of hospital admissions in the last 6 and 12 months, respectively, were analyzed and adjusted for covariates. Results:Prevalence of frailty was high, that is, 83.6% according to the FI and 55.3% according to the FRAIL questionnaire.

However, neural tasks operate within the context of sustained cognitive states, which can be assessed with 'background connectivity' following the removal of task effects. To date, little is known about the integrity of brain processes supporting the maintenance of a cognitive state in individuals with psychotic disorders. Thus, here we examine background connectivity during executive processing in a cohort of participants with first-episode psychosis (FEP). Methods The following fMRI study examined background connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), during working memory engagement in a group of 43 patients with FEP, relative to 35 healthy controls (HC). Findings were also examined in relation to measures of executive function. Results The FEP group relative to HC showed significantly lower background DLPFC connectivity with bilateral superior parietal lobule (SPL) and left inferior parietal lobule. Background connectivity between DLPFC and SPL was also positively associated with overall cognition across all subjects and in our FEP group. In comparison, resting-state frontoparietal connectivity did not differ between groups and was not significantly associated with overall cognition, suggesting that psychosis-related alterations in executive networks only emerged during states of goal-oriented behavior.

The current study examined whether performance on a Go/No-go (GNG) task, and computational modeling to extract latent cognitive variables, could enhance prediction of suicide attempts within next 90 days, among individuals at high-risk for suicide. Method 136 Veterans at high-risk for suicide previously completed a computer-based GNG task requiring rapid responding (Go) to target stimuli, while withholding responses (No-go) to infrequent foil stimuli; behavioral variables included false alarms to foils (failure to inhibit) and missed responses to targets. We conducted a secondary analysis of these data, with outcomes defined as actual suicide attempt (ASA), other suicide-related event (OtherSE) such as interrupted/aborted attempt or preparatory behavior, or neither (noSE), within 90-days after GNG testing, to examine whether GNG variables could improve ASA prediction over standard clinical variables. A computational model (linear ballistic accumulator, LBA) was also applied, to elucidate cognitive mechanisms underlying group differences. Results On GNG, increased miss rate selectively predicted ASA, while increased false alarm rate predicted OtherSE (without ASA) within the 90-day follow-up window. In LBA modeling, ASA (but not OtherSE) was associated with decreases in decisional efficiency to targets, suggesting differences in the evidence accumulation process were specifically associated with upcoming ASA.

In line with this notion it has been consistently shown that psychiatric diagnoses are more frequent in urban compared to rural regions. Most of the studies addressing potential causal mechanisms of this urban-rural difference focus on detrimental aspects of city living. In contrast, biophilia theory has posited an automatic, potentially deep-rooted need for contact with nature. Acting against this proposed tendency to seek contact to natural environments may affect mental health. As scientific evidence for this psycho-evolutionary biophilia theory is lacking by now, we utilized implicit test strategies developed to assess automatic associations between mental representations and action tendencies to put this theory to test. In an online study (N = 109), we administered three reaction time paradigms: the dot probe task (DPT), the implicit association test (IAT) and the approach avoidance task (AAT). All tasks reveal a tendency to approach nature and avoid cities (DPT: F(1,105) = 11.15, p = .001, eta(2) = 0.096; IAT: F(1,107) = 17.10,p = 7.068E-5, eta(2) = 0.138; AAT: F(1,103) = 4.36, p = .039, eta(2) = 0.041). Interestingly, the results of the AAT, the only test that allows this differentiation, suggest that the tendency to approach nature seems to play a more important role than the avoidance of built environments. The present findings provide clear evidence in support of biophilia theory and can therefore inspire and foster further studies investigating whether acting against an automatic and potentially deep-rooted need for contact with nature, by living in cities e.g., may contribute more prominently to the emergence of mental health problems than (or at least in addition to) environmental or societal stressors individuals are exposed to in cities.",FEB 2022,79,2022,2021-11-25,FEB,Journal,N,0272-4944,1522-9610,10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.101725,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,Testing the Biophilia theory: Automatic approach tendencies towards nature,J ENVIRON PSYCHOL,J.

We advance a social network explanation for this phenomenon: ethnic homophily. We theorize that East Asians (e.g., ethnic Chinese)-but not South Asians (e.g., ethnic Indians)-are less likely than other ethnicities to emerge as leaders in multiethnic environments partly because East Asians socialize more with ethnic ingroup members (other East Asians). Analyzing a survey of 54,620 Juris Doctor (JD) students from 124 U.S. law schools, Study 1 revealed that East Asians had the highest ethnic homophily of all ethnicities. Studies 2 and 3 examined friendship networks and leadership emergence in 11 class sections of new Master of Business Administration (MBA) students in a U.S. business school, and found that East Asians were the least likely to be nominated and elected as leaders. Social network analysis revealed that, compared to South Asians, Latinos, and Whites, East Asians exhibited higher ethnic homophily, which mediated their lower leadership emergence. These effects occurred for both East Asian internationals and East Asian Americans, and were robust after accounting for variables such as assertiveness (parallel mediator), network centrality, English proficiency, demographics, and personality. By integrating social network analysis into psychology, we identify ethnic homophily as one reason why the Bamboo Ceiling exists for East Asians but not South Asians.

Methods: The study adopted a cluster-randomized controlled trial design, and 1184 students in 12 schools were randomized to intervention or control groups. After baseline assessment, the intervention group received a peer-led theory-based oral health intervention, while the control group received booklets for oral health promotion. Self-reported brushing and flossing, Health Belief Model/Social Cognitive Theory constructs, and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) were measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, and dental plaque accumulation and caries status were measured at baseline and 12 months. The trial was registered at https://www.clinicaltrials. gov (NCT03694496). Results: Brushing, flossing, and OHRQoL improved more in the experimental group than in the control group at the 6-month follow-up compared with baseline (p < .001). The mean gain score difference was .81 for brushing, .47 for flossing, and-2.51 for OHRQoL. At the 12-month follow-up, the mean gain score of brushing frequency, plaque index, caries status, and OHRQoL were .18,-.28,-.32, and-2.79, respectively, which all sustained the significant difference (p < .001). Conclusions: Our findings suggested that the Health Belief Model combined with Social Cognitive Theory in a peer-led intervention is effective to increase self-reported brushing frequency and improve oral hygiene status and OHRQoL among adolescents.

Agent-based modelling, a simulation paradigm that allows modelling individual behaviour mechanisms to observe the emergence of macro-level patterns, has not employed empirical data regarding route choice behaviour in cities or accommodated heterogeneity. The aim of this paper is to present an empirically based Agent-Based Model (ABM) that accounts for behavioural heterogeneity in pedestrian route choice strategies, to simulate the movement of pedestrians in cities. We designed a questionnaire to observe to what degree people employ salient urban elements (local and global landmarks, regions, and barriers) and road costs (road distance, cumulative angular change) and to empirically characterise the agent behaviour in our ABM. We hypothesised that a heterogeneous ABM configuration based on the construction of agent typologies from empirical data would portray a more plausible picture of pedestrian movement flows than a homogeneous configuration, based on the same data, or a random configuration. The city of Minster (DE) was used as a case study. From a sample of 301 subjects, we obtained six clusters that differed in relation to the role of global elements (distant landmarks, barriers, and regions) and meaningful local elements along the route. The random configuration directed the agents towards natural elements and the streets of the historical centre. The empirically based configurations resulted in lower pedestrian volumes along roads designed for cars (25% decrease) but higher concentrations along the city Promenade and the lake (40% increase); based on our knowledge, we deem these results more plausible. Minor differences were identified between the heterogeneous and homogeneous configurations. These findings indicate that the inclusion of heterogeneity does not make a difference in terms of global patterns. Yet, we demonstrated that simulation models of pedestrian movement in cities should be at least based on empirical data at the average sample-level to inform urban planners about areas prone to high volumes of pedestrians.",AUG 2022,82,2022,2022-08-01,AUG,Journal,N,0272-4944,1522-9610,10.1016/j.jenvp.2022.101807,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,Empirical characterisation of agents' spatial behaviour in pedestrian movement simulation,J ENVIRON PSYCHOL,J.

We summarize evidence regarding the efficacy of web-based self-directed psychological interventions on depressive, anxiety and distress symptoms in people living with a chronic health condition. Method We searched Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE databases and Cochrane Database from 1990 to 1 May 2019. English language papers of randomized controlled trials (usual care or waitlist control) of web-based psychological interventions with a primary or secondary aim to reduce anxiety, depression or distress in adults with a chronic health condition were eligible. Results were assessed using narrative synthases and random-effects meta-analyses. Results In total 70 eligible studies across 17 health conditions [most commonly: cancer (k = 20), chronic pain (k = 9), arthritis (k = 6) and multiple sclerosis (k = 5), diabetes (k = 4), fibromyalgia (k = 4)] were identified. Interventions were based on CBT principles in 46 (66%) studies and 42 (60%) included a facilitator. When combining all chronic health conditions, web-based interventions were more efficacious than control conditions in reducing symptoms of depression g = 0.30 (95% CI 0.22-0.39), anxiety g = 0.19 (95% CI 0.12-0.27), and distress g = 0.36 (95% CI 0.23-0.49).

Method: A sample of 422 care-experienced young people was evaluated by their residential or care workers (n = 219) using the staff version of PLANEA instruments. Psychometric analyses were carried out to study dimensionality and measuring properties of the instruments, while t-tests, Pearson correlations and Fisher's z were used to study convergence between informants. Results: The results show that the internal structure of the instruments was confirmed for the staff versions (three first-order factors and one second-order factor model for PLANEA-S, unidimensional model for PLANEA-9-S, and two-factor correlated model for PLANEA-T-S). The instruments showed excellent reliability (omega = .80-.97) and discriminative capacity. Staff showed less optimistic views than young people about their independent living skills but not their autonomy to perform everyday life tasks. This was mediated by the role of the adult respondent towards the young person evaluated. Conclusions: As conclusions we can say that the validated staff version of the PLANEA Independent Life Skills Assessment tools expands the scope for assessing this construct in young people in care from a multi-informant perspective.

In this observational population-based study, we examined longitudinal changes in the prevalence of mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 crisis and identified subgroups that are psychologically vulnerable during the pandemic. Methods Participants (N = 14 393; observations = 48 486) were adults drawn from wave 9 (2017-2019) of the nationally representative United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) and followed-up across three waves of assessment in April, May, and June 2020. Mental health problems were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Results The population prevalence of mental health problems (GHQ-12 score > 3) increased by 13.5 percentage points from 24.3% in 2017-2019 to 37.8% in April 2020 and remained elevated in May (34.7%) and June (31.9%) 2020. All sociodemographic groups examined showed statistically significant increases in mental health problems in April 2020. The increase was largest among those aged 18-34 years (18.6 percentage points, 95% CI 14.3-22.9%), followed by females and high-income and education groups. Levels of mental health problems subsequently declined between April and June 2020 but remained significantly above pre-COVID-19 levels. Additional analyses showed that the rise in mental health problems observed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was unlikely to be due to seasonality or year-to-year variation.

Based on the potential growth model, the growth trends and relationships of these variables were analyzed based on the longitudinal data of 455 fintech chatbot users in Taiwan in three stages over six months. The results of the survey support all hypotheses and can enable vendors to understand the mechanism of how to enhance users' continuous intention for fintech chatbots.",APR 2022,129,2022,2022-01-16,APR,Journal,N,0747-5632,1873-7692,10.1016/j.chb.2021.107027,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Predicting continuance intention to fintech chatbot,COMPUT HUM BEHAV,Comput.

The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) is a useful framework for investigating activity but leaves variance unexplained. We explored the utility of a dual-process approach using the TPB and the Prototype Willingness Model (PWM) to investigate correlates of physical activity, and 1-year change in physical activity, among a large sample of adolescents. Design A cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of baseline and follow-up data from the Fit to Study cluster-randomized trial. Methods A total of 9,699 secondary school pupils at baseline and 4,632 at follow-up (mean age = 12.5 years) completed measures of past week physical activity and constructs from both behaviour-change models, at time-points 1 year apart. Cross-sectional analyses used multilevel, stepwise regression models to measure the strength of associations between model constructs and physical activity, and variance in behaviour explained by PWM over and above TPB. In longitudinal analyses, change scores were calculated by subtracting follow-up from baseline scores. Models controlling for trial treatment status measured the strength of associations between change scores, and variance explained. Results At baseline, after controlling for past behaviour, physically active prototype similarity had the strongest relationship with activity after the intention to be active. Change in prototype similarity had the strongest relationship with change in activity after the change in intention and attitudes. Prototype perceptions and willingness explained additional variance in behaviour. Conclusion A dual-process model incorporating prototype perceptions could more usefully predict physical activity than models based on rational expectations alone.

Orchestration in a network of individuals is essentially a form of brokering behavior. While most previous studies of orchestration and brokerage have adopted a broker-centric perspective, the present study advances an alter-oriented account of how brokering behavior influences relationships to create knowledge-related benefits for individual network members. Drawing on interviews with 51 members of a Belgian knowledge network focusing on best practices in research and development, this study explores the orchestrator's brokering behavior and ensuing benefits for network members. Based on these findings, the study describes an integrative model of alter-oriented brokering processes that modify, intermediate, and maintain relationships among alters in orchestrated knowledge networks.

This nonexperimental, correlational study had four core aims: to examine whether increases in social anxiety would relate to (1) increased phone usage during social interactions in groups or (2) phone dependency; to examine whether intolerance of uncertainty and motivation of phone use mediated either of these relationships.

This study aimed to investigate rates, correlates, and consequences of child marriage among Syrian refugees in South Lebanon.
Methods: A sample of 1,593 female adolescents and 893 adults was selected using a multistage stratified cluster survey design. We quantified the cumulative incidence of child marriage among age cohorts of female refugees and identified risk factors associated with child marriage using survival methods. We also presented sexual and reproductive health measures among child brides.
Results: We found evidence that child marriage was widely practiced among adolescent girls, with KaplaneMeier curves showing that 32.56% of girls aged 10-19 transitioned to marriage by age 17. Although high, this was lower than rates among women aged 25-29 (p < .005), indicating that child marriage was already widely practiced in prewar Syria. Our Cox models indicated that several factors, which mirror drivers of child marriage in stable settings, are associated with hazard of child marriage in this context. We additionally found important sexual and reproductive health gaps among child brides, such as low levels of knowledge of the dangers of early childbearing and closely spaced births as well as high rates of early and multiple births.
Conclusions: Child marriage is a pervasive practice among Syrian refugees residing in this setting. Our results suggest that a confluence of factors at different levels of the social ecology increase refugee girls' vulnerability to child marriage. They also demonstrate the pressing need for interventions that target refugee child brides. (C) 2022 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

To that end, we propose a conceptual model of interpersonal chemistry centered around the notion that when two or more individuals experience chemistry with one another, they experience their interaction as something more than the sum of their separate contributions. Our model stipulates that chemistry encompasses both behavior (i.e., what chemistry ""looks like"") and its perception (i.e., what it ""feels like""). The behavior involves interaction sequences in which synchronicity is high and in which people's goals are expressed and responded to in supportive and encouraging ways. The perception of chemistry includes cognitive (i.e., perception of shared identity), affective (i.e., positive affect and attraction), and behavioral (i.e., perceived goal-relevant coordination) components. We review existing research on chemistry as well as supporting evidence from relevant topics (e.g., attraction, similarity, perceived partner responsiveness, synchrony) that inform and support this model.

Translational Abstract
Researchers increasingly use Bayes factor for hypotheses evaluation. However, Bayes factors do not actually evaluate hypotheses, they evaluate the prior distributions corresponding to these hypotheses. Loosely formulated, prior distributions represent for each hypotheses how each possible value of the parameters appearing in the hypothesis should be weighted. Whereas researchers using the Bayes factor while analyzing their data find it relatively easy to specify hypotheses, it is often not completely clear how the prior distributions should be specified. As will be shown in this article, in the context of the normal linear model, one solution to this problem is obtained if the Bayes factor of the null-hypothesis versus the alternative hypothesis is calibrated such that it is 19 if the observed effect size equals zero. If this calibration is used, the prior distributions corresponding to each hypothesis can uniquely be determined and do no longer have to be specified by the researchers using Bayes factor. With this article come R functions that can be used to apply the approach prosed in combination with the R package bain (https://informative-hypotheses.sites.uu.nl/software/bain/).",OCT 2022,27,2022,2021-09-27,OCT,Journal,N,1082-989X,1939-1463,10.1037/met0000292,NA,MEDLINE:34570555,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS,Prior Sensitivity of Null Hypothesis Bayesian Testing,PSYCHOL METHODS,Psychol.

This cross-sectional study included 424 questionnaire surveys with drivers (bus and truck) and 10 KIIs. Chi-squared tests were used to measure differences between various parameters (related to smoking habits and driving), while logistic regression models were used to determine the relationship between RTA risk factors and socio-demographic features and other variables. The study results show that about 75.9% of respondents were tobacco users, and among them, 75.9% use Sadapata. Therefore, 57.9% of respondents smoke while driving, and 75.6% used SLT < 10 times while driving. About 64.6% of respondents were involved in RTAs where buses (25.3%), trucks (17.5%), and cars (17.5%) are responsible for RTAs. Statistically, a significant association was found between RTAs and smoking while driving (p < 0.003). The non-licensed drivers are about 3.8 times more likely to be in RTAs than licensed drivers, with a trust period ranging from 1.12 to 13.72.

Objective: The objective was to examine the clinimetric sensitivity of the operational definitions of treatment response, partial response, and remission in children and adults with OCD. Methods: Pre- and post-treatment data from five clinical trials and three cohort studies of children and adults with OCD (n = 1,528; 55.3% children, 61.1% female) were pooled. We compared (1) responders, partial responders, and non-responders and (2) remitters and non-remitters on self-reported OCD symptoms, clinician-rated general functioning, and self-reported quality of life. Remission was also evaluated against post-treatment diagnostic interviews. Results: Responders and remitters experienced large improvements across validators. Responders had greater improvements than partial responders and non-responders on self-reported OCD symptoms (Cohen's d 0.65-1.13), clinician-rated functioning (Cohen's d 0.53-1.03), and self-reported quality of life (Cohen's d 0.63-0.73). Few meaningful differences emerged between partial responders and non-responders. Remitters had better outcomes across most validators than non-remitters. Remission criteria corresponded well with absence of post-treatment diagnosis (sensitivity/specificity: 93%/83%). Using both the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and the Clinical Global Impression Scale yielded more conservative results and more robust changes across validators, compared to only using the Y-BOCS.

Little is known about sources of resilience. Building on our previous work on the contribution of callous-unemotional (CU) traits to child aggression in Colombia, we examined whether positive parenting is protective for children whose families are exposed to community violence. Methods Families were recruited from three demographically contrasting regions of Colombia. The sample comprised 235 children aged 3.5 years and their mothers, of whom 220 (93%) were followed up at age 5.0 years. Positive parenting was assessed as the average of maternal warmth and reciprocity, and as praise, and negative parenting as the average of negative affect and conflict seen in video recordings of standardized procedures. CU traits and oppositional defiant disorder were assessed by maternal report at ages 3.5 and 5.0 years, and mothers reported exposure to community violence over the 18 months between assessments. A range of potential confounds was included in adjusted analyses. Results In the families who were exposed to community violence, but not in the unexposed, maternal warmth and reciprocity were associated prospectively with lower CU traits (interaction, p = .007). In the exposed group maternal warmth and reciprocity explained 10% of the variance (beta = -.34, p = .001). Maternal praise was not associated with CU traits. Maternal negative parenting predicted higher CU traits as the main effect but not in interaction with community violence exposure. Conclusions Maternal warmth and reciprocity with young children may promote resilience in the face of community violence. Programmes to enhance these protective processes may be needed especially where prospects for reducing community violence are limited.

This study examined the joint implications of both the quantity and quality of postdisaster received social support for PTG. Method: Data were collected from Lushan earthquake (China, in 2013) survivors at 7 (n = 199) and 31 (n = 161) months after the earthquake. The main effects of quantity and quality of received support, and the interaction between support quantity and support quality, were examined using hierarchical multiple regression analyses controlling for the extent of disaster exposure, postdisaster negative life events, and sociodemographic factors. Results: Neither quantity nor quality of received social support exerted significant main effects on PTG. However, the influence of the amount of received social support on PTG was moderated by the quality of received social support. Among survivors who appraised the postdisaster social support they received as higher in quality, greater amounts of received support were associated with more subsequent PTG. Among those survivors who appraised the postdisaster social support they received as lower in quality, greater quantity of received support was associated with lower levels of reported PTG. Conclusion: This study calls attention to the importance of enhancing the quality of help provided to disaster survivors because simply ""more"" support is not necessarily better.
Clinical Impact Statement This study shows that receiving efficacious social support following potentially traumatic events may promote emergence of psychological benefits and advantageous transformations. Receiving help from others may facilitate posttraumatic growth, but it is its quality that matters the most. Received social support that does not adequately meet survivors' specific needs, that is not delivered skillfully, and/or is not delivered in a timely fashion, could be potentially disadvantageous for the experience of posttraumatic growth.

Drawing on the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions and prior research, psychological strengths associated with resilience, such as optimism and gratitude, have the potential to be associated with attenuated suicidal ideation among sexual assault survivors. Method: We tested this possibility in a sample of 425 undergraduate women who reported unwanted sexual experiences during adolescence or adulthood. Results: A linear regression analysis revealed that greater sexual assault-related posttraumatic stress symptoms in the past month were associated with greater concurrent suicidal ideation. However, moderation analyses revealed the link between assault-related posttraumatic stress and suicidal ideation was attenuated for individuals higher in optimism and gratitude. Further, at the highest levels of optimism and gratitude, there was no longer a significant association between posttraumatic stress and suicidal ideation. Conclusions: Given optimism and gratitude are modifiable strengths that individuals can develop and grow over time, these results suggest boosting optimism and gratitude may be a valuable way to attenuate thoughts of suicide in interventions for college women who have experienced sexual assault.
Clinical Impact Statement After a sexual assault, posttraumatic stress symptoms are often associated with thoughts of suicide. To inform intervention strategies that promote survivors' wellbeing and reduce suicidal ideation, we examined the psychological strengths of optimism and gratitude as possible protective factors. Among college women sexual assault survivors, optimism and gratitude attenuated the link between sexual assault-related posttraumatic stress and suicidal ideation. These findings indicate that survivors who are more optimistic or grateful are less likely to have posttraumatic stress symptoms progress to severe thoughts of suicide.

This study assessed (1) trends in alcohol, nicotine, and nonprescribed pain reliever use and (2) changes in associations of cannabis use with these other substances among young adults in Washington State after nonmedical cannabis legalization. Methods: Regression models stratified by age (18-20 vs. 21-25) were used to analyze six annual waves of cross-sectional survey data from a statewide sample from 2014 through 2019 (N 1/4 12,694). Results: Prevalence of past-month alcohol use, heavy episodic drinking (HED), and cigarette use and prevalence of past-year pain reliever misuse decreased, while the prevalence of past-month e-cigarette use increased since 2016 (the first year assessed). Across years and age groups, the prevalence of substance use other than cannabis was higher among occasional and frequent cannabis users compared to cannabis nonusers. However, associations between both occasional (1-19 days in the prior month) and frequent (20 thorn days) cannabis use and pain reliever misuse and between frequent cannabis use and HED weakened over time among individuals ages 21-25. Discussion: Contrary to concerns about spillover effects, implementation of legalized nonmedical cannabis coincided with decreases in alcohol and cigarette use and pain reliever misuse. The weakening association of cannabis use with the use of other substances among individuals ages 21-25 requires further research but may suggest increased importance of cannabis-specific prevention and treatment efforts.(c) 2022 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

The results of three empirical studies indicate that the donation collection method affects the amounts donated for the cause and overhead, in addition to the total donation amount. Study 1 shows that donors tend to donate more for the cause when the collection method asks them to add an extra amount for overhead to the amount donated for the cause (i.e., cause-first addition) than when the collection method asks donors to allocate their total donation amounts to the cause and overhead (i.e., allocation), which also affects the total donation amount. Studies 2 and 3 test the effects of the donation collection order by comparing between the cause-first and the overhead-first addition methods. Results show that donors tend to donate more to the cause and overhead when the donation amount for overhead is asked first (i.e., overhead-first) than when the donation amount for the cause is asked first (i.e., cause-first).

Drawing on a national panel survey, this study explores the cognitive processes by which social media news users learn new perspectives from disagreement via the mediating role of interpersonal discussion and the moderating role of fact-checking. The results reveal that social media news use is positively associated with learning from disagreement, and this relationship is mediated by like-minded and cross-cutting discussions. Specifically, while cross-cutting discussions facilitate individuals' understanding and learning of opposing viewpoints, like-minded discussions hinder this process. Furthermore, fact-checking has the potential to reinforce not only tolerant attitudes toward opposing viewpoints but also individuals' pre-existing beliefs and impede learning from disagreement. The mixed effect of fact-checking depends on the type of interpersonal discussion taking place.

Not only has the pandemic impacted individual mental health and well-being, it is compounded by exposure to mental health concerns of people in their network. Prevention and intervention strategies should focus on young people not only as individuals who may need to be connected to mental health resources for themselves, but to support and help them process effects of more vicarious self-directed violence exposure. Encouraging youth to create positive community connections is a modifiable protective factor.
Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created a sudden shift in the social lives of youth with important negative impacts on mental health. The current article aims to understand how the pandemic may have differentially impacted the mental health of adolescents and young adults with recent (1 year or less) and past (>1 year) exposure to self-directed violence (SDV). Method: Data were collected online from 990 youth and young adults, aged 13-23 years between November 27, 2020 and December 11, 2020. Results: Participants who had recently been exposed to SDV reported being more impacted by the pandemic and had poorer mental health indicators. Participants with past SDV exposure who engaged in a high number of prosocial activities (e.g., talking with friends) were less likely to report depressive symptoms (beta = -.13, p = .01) than similarly engaged nonexposed participants; the same was true for recently exposed participants (beta = -.14, p = .02).

Translational Abstract Researchers often care about whether variables or sets of variables contribute to predicting an outcome above and beyond other variables, thereby seeking to evaluate their incremental validity. Unfortunately, traditional regression-based methods have a number of limitations that restrict the amount and quality of information that can be gleaned in such an assessment. In the current work, a strategy based in structural equation modeling is offered that greatly enhances researchers' ability to investigate incremental validity, where the predictors of focal interest can be measured variables or latent constructs, and where they can be studied as individual predictors or in blocks. With the proposed analytical approach, researchers need only a single structural model to assess the incremental validity of multiple predictors predicting one or more outcomes. The basic structural model can also be flexibly extended to answer other interesting questions concerning incremental validity, such as differences in incremental validity patterns across multiple populations. Two empirical examples are included in this article to demonstrate how to apply the proposed methods in different applied research scenarios.

There are gender differences in depression and vitamin D level. However, the relationship between depression, gender, vitamin D, cognition, and brain function has yet to be determined. Methods One hundred and twenty-two patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 119 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional MRI and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) was calculated to assess brain function. Serum concentration of vitamin D (SCVD) and cognition (i.e. prospective memory and sustained attention) were also measured. Results We found a significant group-by-gender interaction effect on SCVD whereby MDD patients showed a reduction in SCVD relative to controls in females but not males. Concurrently, there was a female-specific association of SCVD with cognition and MDD-related fALFF alterations in widespread brain regions. Remarkably, MDD- and SCVD-related fALFF changes mediated the relation between SCVD and cognition in females. Conclusion Apart from providing insights into the neural mechanisms by which low vitamin D contributes to cognitive impairment in MDD in a gender-dependent manner, these findings might have clinical implications for assignment of female patients with MDD and cognitive dysfunction to adjuvant vitamin D supplementation therapy, which may ultimately advance a precision approach to personalized antidepressant choice.",JUL 2023,53,2023,2022-04-01,JUL,Journal,N,0033-2917,1469-8978,10.1017/S0033291722000708,NA,MEDLINE:35362398,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,Brain function mediates the association between low vitamin D and neurocognitive status in female patients with major depressive disorder,PSYCHOL MED,Psychol.

However, traditional approaches are strict, vary across the field in implementation, and present multiplicity challenges, even in the simplest case of two groups under study. The alignment method was recently proposed as an alternative approach. This method is more automated, requires fewer decisions from researchers, and accommodates two or more groups. However, it has different assumptions, estimation techniques, and limitations from traditional approaches. To address the lack of accessible resources that explain the methodological differences and complexities between the two approaches, we introduce and illustrate both, comparing them side by side.

Based on this overview, we propose a list of four key considerations to help researchers decide which approach to choose and how to document their analytical decisions in a preregistration or analysis plan. We then demonstrate our key considerations on an illustrative research question using an open dataset and provide an example of a completed preregistration. Our illustrative example is accompanied by an annotated analysis report that shows readers, step-by-step, how to conduct measurement invariance tests using R and Mplus. Finally, we provide recommendations for how to decide between and use each approach and next steps for methodological research.
Translational Abstract Measurement invariance refers to the notion that a scale measures a construct the same way across different groups, contexts, or time. If a personality scale measures personality differently for men and women, for example, then men and women cannot be compared on that personality scale because any observed differences could simply be measurement differences. The traditional approaches for assessing measurement invariance use confirmatory factor analyses, require statistical expertise, and become problematic when many groups are tested. The alignment method for assessing measurement invariance is a recently developed alternative to the traditional approaches which addresses some of their disadvantages and works well with many groups but has its own assumptions and limitations. In this tutorial, we introduce and illustrate both approaches for testing measurement invariance to help researchers decide which approach to choose and how to document their analytical decisions in a preregistration or analysis plan. First, we overview the concepts, assumptions, advantages, and limitations of each approach. Based on this overview, we propose a list of four key considerations to help researchers decide which approach to choose. We then illustrate how to use our key considerations by answering a mock research question using an open dataset, which is accompanied by an example of a completed preregistration. We also provide an annotated analysis report with code that shows readers, step-by-step, how to conduct measurement invariance tests using statistical programs R and Mplus.

Integrity of white matter microstructure plays a key role in the neural mechanism of ADHD presentations. However, the relationships between specific behavioural dimensions and white matter microstructure are less well known. This study aimed to identify associations between white matter and a broad set of clinical features across children and adolescent with and without ADHD using a data-driven multivariate approach. Method We recruited a total of 130 children (62 controls and 68 ADHD) and employed regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis to characterize the associations between white matter and a comprehensive set of clinical measures covering three domains, including symptom, cognition and behaviour. We further applied linear discriminant analysis to integrate these associations to explore potential developmental effects. Results We delineated two brain-behaviour dimensional associations in each domain resulting a total of six multivariate patterns of white matter microstructural alterations linked to hyperactivity-impulsivity and mild affected; executive functions and working memory; externalizing behaviour and social withdrawal, respectively. Apart from executive function and externalizing behaviour sharing similar white matter patterns, all other dimensions linked to a specific pattern of white matter microstructural alterations. The multivariate dimensional association scores showed an overall increase and normalization with age in ADHD group while remained stable in controls. Conclusions We found multivariate neurobehavioral associations exist across ADHD and controls, which suggested that multiple white matter patterns underlie ADHD heterogeneity and provided neural bases for more precise diagnosis and individualized treatment.",FEB 2023,64,2023,2022-08-24,FEB,Journal,N,0021-9630,1469-7610,10.1111/jcpp.13689,NA,MEDLINE:36000340,NA,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY,Multivariate associations between behavioural dimensions and white matter across children and adolescents with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,J CHILD PSYCHOL PSYC,J.

Additionally, this study suggests that incoming college students with a greater history of interpersonal trauma exposure may be at increased risk for developing TRD and using greater amounts of cannabis use. Our results emphasize the importance of providing education about the risks of cannabis use to college students, as well as processing interpersonal traumas at they are a strong predictor of posttrauma psychopathology and greater amounts of cannabis use, which is a risk factor for problematic cannabis use.
Objective: College students are at high risk for cannabis use, interpersonal trauma (IPT) exposure, and trauma-related distress (TRD). Two phenotypic etiologic models posited to explain associations between cannabis use and trauma-related phenotypes are the self-medication (trauma/TRD -> cannabis use) and high-risk (cannabis use -> trauma/TRD) hypotheses. The primary objective of the present study was to investigate direct and indirect associations among cannabis use, IPT exposure, and TRD above and beyond established covariates. Method: The current study used data from the first assessment (i.e., baseline survey at Year 1 Fall) and two follow-up assessments (i.e., Year 1 Spring and Year 2 Spring) from an ongoing longitudinal study on college behavioral health. Participants were 4 cohorts of college students (n = 9,889) who completed measures of demographics, substance use, IPT, and TRD. Indirect effects of IPT on cannabis through TRD (i.e., self-medication) and cannabis on TRD through IPT (i.e., high-risk), including tests of covariate effects (e.g., gender, age, race, cohort, alcohol, nicotine), were simultaneously estimated using a longitudinal mediation modeling framework. Results: Results suggest that more IPT exposure increases risk for TRD and subsequent nonexperimental (use 6+ times) cannabis use, and that experimental (use 1-5 times) and nonexperimental cannabis use increases risk for IPT exposure and subsequent TRD. Conclusions: Both the self-medication and high-risk hypotheses were supported. Findings support a bidirectional causal relationship between cannabis use and trauma-related phenotypes.

In four studies, we demonstrate that consumers respond to date-specific promotions more positively when they are sent in advance than when they are sent on specific days, especially for companies perceived as less warm (vs. warm). Sending promotions on the exact day elicits an ulterior motive inference from consumers regarding the company, which can be alleviated by sending promotions in advance.

Among the factors that could explain this difference would be the sexual double standard (SDS). Sexual concordance is examined by SDS typologies of adherence (egalitarian, man-favorable, and woman-favorable). Method: During exposure to a film with sexual content, genital response (penile circumference/vaginal pulse amplitude) and self-reported sexual arousal were recorded in 104 young adults (42 men and 62 women), distributed into SDS typologies of adherence on the basis of their scores on the Sexual Double Standard Scale.Results: Sexual concordance was obtained in men and women with egalitarian and man-favorable typology. Subjective sexual arousal explained a significant percentage of the variance in genital response in the egalitarian typology (men: R-2 = .32, p < .01; women: R-2 = .19, p < .05) and man-favorable typology (men: R-2 = .21, p < .05; women: R-2 = .23, p < .05).

In addition, trauma-exposed women in low- versus high-estradiol menstrual cycle phases show greater sympathetic and lower hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity to a trauma reminder, more severe daily PTSD symptoms, and more variable daily affect. These results have potential implications for clinical assessment, as menstrual cycle phase at the time of assessment could influence PTSD diagnosis. Additionally, clinicians working with women with PTSD might anticipate greater affective lability and increased symptoms during low-estradiol menstrual cycle phases.
Objective: Women experience higher risk for PTSD following trauma compared with men. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones might contribute to this greater vulnerability, given that estradiol is associated with affect and stress reactivity. Our objective was to test the relations between menstrual cycle-related changes in estradiol, affect, stress reactivity, and trauma-related symptoms. Method: We assessed trauma-related symptoms in ethnically diverse naturally cycling women with a history of trauma during a clinical interview. Participants also completed a 10-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) that included lower- and higher-estradiol phases. We tested associations between estradiol and PTSD symptoms and stress reactivity to a trauma reminder using Spearman correlation and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. We tested the effect of menstrual cycle day on daily affect using multilevel modeling. Results: Estradiol was negatively associated with symptom severity (r(s) = -.36), and participants in low- versus high-estradiol cycle phases at interview had higher sympathetic (r = .35) and lower hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (r = .41) reactivity. Across the EMA period, participants showed a decrease in daily PTSD symptoms (b = -.39), negative (b = -.11) and positive (b = -.24) affect, and variability in daily valence (b = -.07) and arousal (b = -.08), from the low- to high-estradiol phase. Conclusions: Consistent with prior evidence of more aversive affective experiences in low-estradiol states, lower estradiol was associated with higher trauma-related symptoms. In addition, trauma-exposed women showed a discordant pattern of stress reactivity to a trauma reminder, higher daily symptoms, and greater affective lability in a low-estradiol phase.

Cox regression analyses estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). When they were compared to males who had not been bullies at 8 years of age, frequent male bullies had an increased hazard for violent offenses (adjusted HR 3.01, 95% CI 2.11-4.33) and severe violent offenses (adjusted HR 2.86, 95% CI 1.07-7.59) as adults, even when the data were controlled for them being victims, parental education level, family structure and child psychopathology. Frequent female bullies also had an increased hazard for violent offenses, compared to those who had not bullied others (adjusted HR 5.27, 95% CI 1.51-18.40).

Contraceptive use can reduce this risk. We explored the impact of AIM for Teen Moms, a future-oriented behavioral intervention, on emotional and tangible support and the influence of this support on the attitudes, intentions, and past 3-month contraceptive use behaviors. Method: Participants were 295 first-time moms (ages 15-19) in Los Angeles County who participated in a randomized control trial intervention to reduce rapid repeat pregnancies. Participants completed surveys at baseline and 36-months. Hypotheses were tested using multivariate and interaction analysis. Results: Teen mothers in treatment group reported more emotional (0 =.13, p < .05) and tangible support (0 =.13, p < .05). Higher tangible support was positively associated with birth control attitudes (0 =.13, p < .05), which, in turn, predicted intention to use birth control (0 =.31, p < .001). Intention to use birth control also predicted higher past 3-month birth control use (0 =.18, p < .01); there was also a direct path from attitude to 3-month birth control use (0 =.35, p < .001). There was no association between emotional support and birth control attitudes, intentions, or behaviors. Conclusion: AIM for Teen Mom's effects on contraception use at 36 months was mediated by social support, specifically tangible support, which, in turn, affected birth control attitudes, intentions, and reported birth control use.

Moreover, contrary to recent conceptual work, our findings indicate that AI-enabled automation and augmentation solutions may not be detached from nor exist in tension with each other. They are deeply embedded in organizational processes and workflows for which people who co-exist with the technologies must take ownership. Our findings, in part, go against discussions on AI ""taking over"" jobs or deskilling humans.

Drawing on the categorization-elaboration model (CEM; van Knippenberg, De Dreu, & Homan, 2004), we begin with the assumption that information elaboration is the process whereby gender diversity fosters positive effects on team performance. However, also in line with the CEM, we argue that this process can be disrupted by adverse team dynamics. Specifically, we argue that as time pressure increases, higher gender diversity leads to more team withdrawal, which, in turn, moderates the positive indirect effect of gender diversity on team performance via information elaboration such that this effect becomes weaker as team withdrawal increases. In an experimental study of 142 four-person teams, we found support for this model that explains why perceived time pressure affects the performance of gender-diverse teams more negatively than that of gender-homogeneous teams.

In this research, we draw on the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions to suggest that new parents' positive emotions are not merely an enjoyable distraction, but are instead central to their relational adjustment. Specifically, we hypothesized that new parents who experienced greater positive emotions would report enhanced relationship satisfaction and partner social support across time. To test these ideas, we drew on two dyadic and longitudinal studies of new parents. In Study 1, 104 couples (208 individuals) completed surveys across the course of 1 year, and in Study 2, 192 couples (384 individuals) completed surveys and a laboratory-based social support interaction over the course of 2 years. At each wave of data collection, participants completed assessments of positive emotions, relationship satisfaction, and partner social support. We examined how actor and partner positive emotions longitudinally predicted relational adjustment across time. Results demonstrated that, even when controlling for baseline levels of each outcome variable, greater actor reports of positive emotions prospectively predicted greater subsequent actor (a) relationship satisfaction, (b) perceptions of social support from the partner, and (c) enacted social support as rated by independent observers, a pattern that was especially prominent for fathers.

We highlight the role of the sociopolitical context of prejudice focusing on socioeconomic and legal integration policies. We reason that such integration policies shape intergroup relations by reducing structural (socioeconomic and legal) inequalities. Thus, inclusive policies will effectively reduce prejudice especially at high levels of immigrant presence through empowering immigrants and reducing immigrant disadvantage. Indeed our findings identify inclusive integration policies as a key condition for low anti-immigrant prejudice in high-immigration contexts. We analyze surveys of 143,752 participants across 66 different countries, 20 subnational regions, and 64 institutions as sociopolitical contexts using six different data sets in eight studies.

Methods We estimated cross-sectional networks in two samples of trauma-exposed adults (Sample 1: N = 349 adults; Sample 2: N = 1307 Veterans) to identify PTSD symptoms that may act as bridges to SITB. Additionally, we conducted a cross-lagged panel network in Sample 2 to further clarify the temporal relationship between PTSD symptoms and SITB during a 2-year follow-up. Finally, in both samples, we conducted logistic regressions to examine the utility of PTSD symptoms in prospectively predicting SITB, over a 15-day period (Sample 1) and over a 2-year period (Sample 2), allowing us to examine both short- and long-term prediction. Results Two PTSD symptoms (i.e. negative beliefs and risky behaviors) emerged as highly influential on SITB in both cross-sectional networks. In the cross-lagged panel network, distorted blame emerged as highly influential on SITB over time. Finally, risky behaviors, unwanted memories, and psychological distress served as the strongest predictors of SITB across the two samples.

Conclusions Male subjects with IGD had a lower recruitment coefficient than RGUs, which impairing their impulse control. The mediation results suggest that top-down executive control of the ECN is absent in subjects with IGD.

However, prior research has not focused on or identified definitive predictors of SRI treatment outcomes. Leveraging precision medicine techniques such as machine learning can facilitate the prediction of treatment outcomes. Methods The study used 10-fold cross-validation support vector machine (SVM) learning models to predict three treatment outcomes (i.e. response, partial remission, and full remission) for 97 patients with BDD receiving up to 14-weeks of open-label treatment with the SRI escitalopram. SVM models used baseline clinical and demographic variables as predictors. Feature importance analyses complemented traditional SVM modeling to identify which variables most successfully predicted treatment response. Results SVM models indicated acceptable classification performance for predicting treatment response with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77 (sensitivity = 0.77 and specificity = 0.63), partial remission with an AUC of 0.75 (sensitivity = 0.67 and specificity = 0.73), and full remission with an AUC of 0.79 (sensitivity = 0.70 and specificity = 0.79). Feature importance analyses supported constructs such as better quality of life and less severe depression, general psychopathology symptoms, and hopelessness as more predictive of better treatment outcome; demographic variables were least predictive. Conclusions The current study is the first to demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can successfully predict treatment outcomes for pharmacotherapy for BDD.

The term 'pandemic paranoia' has been coined to refer to heightened levels of mistrust and suspicion towards other people specifically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we examine the international prevalence of pandemic paranoia in the general population and its associated sociodemographic profile.
Methods. A representative international sample of general population adults (N=2510) from five sites (USA N= 535, Germany N= 516, UK N= 512, Australia N= 502 and Hong Kong N=445) were recruited using stratified quota sampling (for age, sex, educational attainment) and completed the Pandemic Paranoia Scale (PPS).
Results. The overall prevalence rate of pandemic paranoia was 19%, and was highest in Australia and lowest in Germany. On the subscales of the PPS, prevalence was 11% for persecutory threat, 29% for paranoid conspiracy and 37% for interpersonal mistrust. Site and general paranoia significantly predicted pandemic paranoia. Sociodemographic variables (lower age, higher population size and income, being male, employed and no migrant status) explained additional variance and significantly improved prediction of pandemic paranoia.
Conclusions. Pandemic paranoia was relatively common in a representative sample of the general population across five international sites.

UC report high trauma exposure and greater posttraumatic stress symptoms compared with youth who immigrate with caregivers. Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) has demonstrated preliminary effectiveness with UC. However, few studies have treated U.S.-based samples of UC, who emigrate primarily from Central America. Method: One hundred thirty-eight UC were referred for treatment and 129 completed a pretreatment assessment including the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Most UC were from Central America (n = 109; 79.0%) and resided in government facilities (n = 76; 55.1%). One hundred twenty-two youth began TF-CBT, had an average of 9.71 sessions (SD = 9.3, range: 1-48), and 41.8% (n = 51) completed treatment. One hundred four youth completed a brief, six-item progress monitoring measure of trauma symptoms, for which 84 had at least two observations during treatment. Results: UC endorsed 3.80 traumatic events on average (SD = 2.38). High rates of violence, physical and sexual abuse, and serious injury were reported. There were significant improvements on most self-report rating scales (p < .05); within-subjects Cohen's d's ranged from .07 to 1.03 for pre- to posttreatment assessments and was d = .44 for the progress monitoring measure. Therapists reported on TF-CBT modifications for UC, including discussing mental health beliefs, navigating roles and relationships, tailoring treatment examples, exploring coping strategies, and addressing immigration factors. Conclusion: Preliminary findings support the utility of TF-CBT with UC. Implications for implementation and cultural modifications are discussed.
Clinical Impact Statement Unaccompanied children (UC) experience significant trauma prior to and during their journey to the United States. Trauma-informed treatment for UC is a public health concern, yet there are limited data on the effectiveness of evidence-based trauma treatment (EBT) for UC. This study examined the effectiveness of an EBT, Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), in a community sample of UC and found that posttraumatic stress symptoms decreased after treatment. Preliminary findings suggest that with modifications (e.g., reducing jargon, using culturally relevant examples) TF-CBT may be a useful treatment for UC.",NA,NA,2022,2022-09-15,SEP 15,Journal,N,1942-9681,1942-969X,10.1037/tra0001361,NA,MEDLINE:36107712,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY,Unaccompanied Migrant Children in the United States: Implementation and Effectiveness of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,PSYCHOL TRAUMA-US,Psychol.

However, as adults with sD are less likely to seek face-to-face intervention, internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) may overcome barriers of accessibility to psychotherapy. Although several trials explored the efficacy of ICBT for sD, the results remain inconsistent. This study evaluated whether ICBT is effective in reducing depressive symptoms among Chinese adults with sD. Methods A randomized controlled trial was performed. The participants were randomly assigned to 5 weeks of ICBT, group-based face-to-face cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or a waiting list (WL). Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-intervention and at a 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome measured depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Outcomes were analyzed using a mixed-effects model to assess the effects of ICBT. Results ICBT participants reported greater reductions on all the outcomes compared to the WL group at post-intervention. The ICBT group showed larger improvement on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at post-intervention (d = 0.12) and at follow-up (d = 0.10), and with CES-D at post-intervention (d = 0.06), compared to the CBT group. Conclusions ICBT is effective in reducing depressive symptoms among Chinese adults with sD, and improvements in outcomes were sustained at a 6-month follow-up.

Recent initiatives have underscored the importance of developing new ways of classifying mental illness based on underlying neural dimensions that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Accordingly, the aim of the study was to clarify reward-related neural circuitry that may characterize depressed-anxious youth. Method: The Boston Adolescent Neuroimaging of Depression and Anxiety Human Connectome Project tested group differences regarding subcortical volume and nucleus accumbens activation during an incentive processing task among 14- to 17-year-old adolescents presenting with a primary depressive and/or anxiety disorder (n = 129) or no lifetime history of mental disorders (n = 64). In addition, multimodal modeling examined predictors of depression and anxiety symptom change over a 6-month follow-up period. Results: Our findings highlighted considerable convergence. Relative to healthy youth, depressed-anxious adolescents exhibited reduced nucleus accumbens volume and activation following reward receipt. These findings remained when removing all medicated participants (w59% of depressed- anxious youth). Subgroup analyses comparing anxious-only, depressed-anxious, and healthy youth also were largely consistent. Multimodal modeling showed that only structural alterations predicted depressive symptoms over time. Conclusion: Multimodal findings highlight alterations within nucleus accumbens structure and function that characterize depressed-anxious adolescents. In the current hypothesis-driven analyses, however, only reduced nucleus accumbens volume predicted depressive symptoms over time. An important next step will be to clarify why structural alterations have an impact on reward-related processes and associated symptoms.",FEB 2022,61,2022,2022-01-20,FEB,Journal,N,0890-8567,1527-5418,10.1016/j.jaac.2021.04.014,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY,Reward-Related Neural Circuitry in Depressed and Anxious Adolescents: A Human Connectome Project,J AM ACAD CHILD PSY,J.

We tested this framework by manipulating stimulus magnitudes. As magnitudes increase, psychophysical noise due to scalar variability widens the perceived range of plausible values for the stimulus. This increased noise, in turn, increases the influence of anchoring bias on judgments. In 11 preregistered experiments (N = 3,552 adults), anchoring effects increased with stimulus magnitude for point estimates of familiar and novel stimuli (e.g., reservation prices for hotels and donuts, counts in dot arrays). Comparisons of relevant and irrelevant anchors showed that noise itself did not produce anchoring effects. Noise amplified anchoring bias.

In this paper, we propose a framework for examining and changing sitting behavior that addresses two key steps in the process towards developing effective interventions. First, we suggest that research should move away from its current focus on sitting time, which is an outcome of behavior. Rather, researchers should focus on stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand transitions, which are discrete units of behavior. Second, drawing on goal hierarchy models, we suggest that people rarely engage in stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand transitions for the purpose of being in a sitting or standing position; rather, we suggest that these transitions are means to higher-order goals (e.g., to complete work tasks, to watch television, to eat dinner). To improve adherence to and effectiveness of sitting behavior interventions, intervention designers should aim to increase the frequency of sit-to-stand (and stand-to-sit) transitions. To achieve this aim, intervention designers should capitalize on the higher-order goals that are typically served by these transitions. We suggest four concrete intervention strategies to increase sit-to-stand transitions in congruence with people's everyday goals.

We argue lobbying breadth serves as a risk management strategy to both hedge against possible government intrusion and minimize disapproval of firm actions from government officials. As such, we posit firms' strategic risk will positively relate to breadth of lobbying firms' target. Further, if lobbying breadth serves as risk management strategy, then other aspects that affect decisions about the amount of risk protection a firm may need should also affect this relationship. We argue that CEOs' ownership and firms' political uncertainty may exacerbate exposure from firm risk taking to government actions, thus strengthening the insurance relationship. Similarly, we argue available slack, as a form of internal insurance against government actions, will weaken the relationship between strategic risk taking and lobbying breadth. We find support for most of our arguments in a sample of U. S. manufacturing firms. This research extends understanding of lobbying beyond the predominant focus on expenditures and securing beneficial outcomes.

Decisions vary in difficulty. Humans know this and typically report more confidence in easy than in difficult decisions. However, confidence reports do not perfectly track decision accuracy, but also reflect response biases and difficulty misjudgements. To isolate the quality of confidence reports, we developed a model of the decision-making process underlying choice-confidence data. In this model, confidence reflects a subject's estimate of the reliability of their decision. The quality of this estimate is limited by the subject's uncertainty about the uncertainty of the variable that informs their decision ('meta-uncertainty'). This model provides an accurate account of choice-confidence data across a broad range of perceptual and cognitive tasks, investigated in six previous studies. We find meta-uncertainty varies across subjects, is stable over time, generalizes across some domains and can be manipulated experimentally.

The 'leapfrog' trial design is a newly-developed simple Bayesian adaptive trial design with potential to accelerate treatment development. A first leapfrog trial was conducted to provide a demonstration and test feasibility, applying the method to a low-intensity internet-delivered intervention targeting anhedonia. Methods At the start of this online, single-blind leapfrog trial, participants self-reporting depression were randomized to an initial control arm comprising four weeks of weekly questionnaires, or one of two versions of a four-week cognitive training intervention, imagery cognitive bias modification (imagery CBM). Intervention arms were compared to control on an ongoing basis via sequential Bayesian analyses, based on a primary outcome of anhedonia at post-intervention. Results were used to eliminate and replace arms, or to promote them to become the control condition based on pre-specified Bayes factor and sample size thresholds. Two further intervention arms (variants of imagery CBM) were added into the trial as it progressed. Results N = 188 participants were randomized across the five trial arms. The leapfrog methodology was successfully implemented to identify a 'winning' version of the imagery CBM, i.e. the version most successful in reducing anhedonia, following sequential elimination of the other arms. Conclusions The study demonstrates feasibility of the leapfrog design and provides a foundation for its adoption as a method to accelerate treatment development in mental health.

Neuroscience aims to understand cognition in the brain by analysing these intricate patterns. We argue that this goal is impeded by the time format of our data-clock time. The brain is a system with its own dynamics and regime of time, with no intrinsic concern for the human-invented second. Here, we present the Brain Time Toolbox, a software library that retunes electrophysiology data in line with oscillations that orchestrate neural patterns of cognition. These oscillations continually slow down, speed up and undergo abrupt changes, introducing a disharmony between the brain's internal regime and clock time. The toolbox overcomes this disharmony by warping the data to the dynamics of coordinating oscillations, setting oscillatory cycles as the data's new time axis. This enables the study of neural patterns as they unfold in the brain, aiding neuroscientific enquiry into dynamic cognition. In support of this, we demonstrate that the toolbox can reveal results that are absent in a default clock time format.",OCT 2022,6,2022,2022-06-20,OCT,Journal,N,2397-3374,NA,10.1038/s41562-022-01386-8,NA,MEDLINE:35726055,NA,NA,NA,NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR,"The brain time toolbox, a software library to retune electrophysiology data to brain dynamics",NAT HUM BEHAV,Nat.

In the domain of intergenerational influence, we study two potential moderating factors suggested in past consumer research: communication effectiveness and peer conformity. Using the co-orientational model and nominal dyad method, we reveal the existence of intergenerational similarity in dyads' sustainable consumer attitudes and behaviors-after accounting for nominal effects- and show that stronger parent-child communication between mother-daughter pairs leads to greater intergenerational similarity, whereas stronger peer influence on daughters reduces intergenerational agreement. Our analysis further suggests the presence of reverse environmental socialization, in which intergenerational influence predominantly occurs from daughter to mother. Dyads' subjective knowledge regarding sustainable consumption provides empirical insights for this co-orientational model finding on reverse intergenerational transfer.

Design: Cluster-randomized controlled trial. Setting: Ten nursing homes in Germany were randomly allocated to the tablet-based intervention (TBI, 5 units) or conventional activity sessions (CAS, 5 units). Participants: N = 162 residents with dementia. Intervention: Participants received regular TBI (n = 80) with stimulating activities developed to engage people with dementia or CAS (n = 82) for 8 weeks. Measurements: Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-I, primary outcome), Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease scale, QUALIDEM scale, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Geriatric Depression Scale, and psychotropic medication (secondary outcomes). Momentary quality of life was assessed before and after each activity session. Participants and staff were blinded until the collection of baseline data was completed. Data were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. Results: Levels of apathy decreased slightly in both groups (mean decrease in AES-I of .61 points, 95% CI -3.54, 2.33 for TBI and .36 points, 95% CI -3.27, 2.55 for CAS).

Moreover, most research considers a limited number of biomarkers, which may not be adequate for tagging complex network-level mechanisms. Here we studied clusters of proteins and examined their relation with MDD and individual depressive symptoms. Methods The sample consisted of 1621 subjects from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). MDD diagnoses were based on DSM-IV criteria and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology questionnaire measured endorsement of 30 symptoms. Serum protein levels were detected using a multi-analyte platform (171 analytes, immunoassay, Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP 250+). Proteomic clusters were computed using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Results Six proteomic clusters were identified, of which one was nominally significantly associated with current MDD (p = 9.62E-03, Bonferroni adj. p = 0.057). This cluster contained 21 analytes and was enriched with pathways involved in inflammation and metabolism [including C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin and insulin]. At the individual symptom level, this proteomic cluster was associated with ten symptoms, among which were five atypical, energy-related symptoms. After correcting for several health and lifestyle covariates, hypersomnia, increased appetite, panic and weight gain remained significantly associated with the cluster. Conclusions Our findings support the idea that alterations in a network of proteins involved in inflammatory and metabolic processes are present in MDD, but these alterations map predominantly to clinical symptoms reflecting an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure.",MAY 2023,53,2023,2022-01-18,MAY,Journal,N,0033-2917,1469-8978,10.1017/S0033291721004888,NA,MEDLINE:35039097,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,Dissection of depression heterogeneity using proteomic clusters,PSYCHOL MED,Psychol.

Accordingly, the present study examined the reliability, validity, factorial structure, and diagnostic sensitivity of a revised version of the scale - the OCI-CV-R- that excludes items assessing hoarding.Methods: Participant were 1047 youth, including 489 meeting DSM criteria for primary OCD, 298 clinical controls, and 260 nonclinical controls, who completed the OCI-CV and measures of obsessive-compulsive symptom severity, depression, and anxiety at various treatment and research centers. Results: Findings support a five-factor structure (doubting/checking, obsessing, washing, ordering, and neutralizing), with a higher order factor. Factorial invariance was found for older (12-17 years) and younger (7-11 years) children. Internal consistency of the OCI-CV-R was acceptable, and discriminant and convergent validity were adequate and akin to that of its progenitor. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were found for a total score of 8 and higher.Conclusion: It is recommended that the OCI-CV-R replace the former version, and that this measure serve as part of a comprehensive clinical assessment of youth with OCD.

Converging research strands indicate that rest-activity rhythms can help characterize BD-I and might differentiate good responders (GR) and non-responders (NR). Methods Seventy outpatients with BD-I receiving Li prophylaxis were categorized as GR or NR according to the ratings on the retrospective assessment of response to lithium scale (Alda scale). Participants undertook 21 consecutive days of actigraphy monitoring of sleep quantity (SQ), sleep variability (SV) and circadian rhythmicity (CR). Results Twenty-five individuals were categorized as GR (36%). After correcting statistical analysis to minimize false discoveries, four variables (intra-daily variability; median activity level; amplitude; and relative amplitude of activity) significantly differentiated GR from NR. The odds of being classified as a GR case were greatest for individuals showing more regular/stable CR (1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08, 2.05; p < 0.04). Also, there was a trend for lower SV to be associated with GR (odds ratio: 0.56; 95% CI 0.31, 1.01; p < 0.06). Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the largest actigraphy study of rest-activity rhythms and Li response. Circadian markers associated with fragmentation, variability, amount and/or amplitude of day and night-time activity best-identified GR. However, associations were modest and future research must determine whether these objectively measured parameters, singly or together, represent robust treatment response biomarkers.

While scientists have moved quickly to study the physical health implications of the disease, less attention has been paid to the negative mental health repercussions. The current study utilized a community sample of adolescents who had recently completed a 2-year, four wave study of adolescent mental health (Wave 1 n = 184, M-age = 13.9 years; 50.3% female). Participants were recontacted to assess their anxiety, depression, and emotion dysregulation symptoms during the pandemic. Latent growth modeling based on four pre-COVID time points indicated the extent to which the fifth (COVID) time point deviated from trend expectations. Results showed that (a) anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher than previous trajectories would have predicted, and (b) deviations from personal trajectories were associated with higher levels of perceived lifestyle impact due to the pandemic. Furthermore, gender-based analyses revealed that financial impacts, lifestyle impacts, and coronavirus fear were differentially associated with symptom increases for male and female participants. The current study is among the first to report that adolescent mental health trajectories have been altered in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. As physical distancing and other safety precautions may be required for several years, it is essential that we gain a deep understanding of how prevention efforts are associated with significant disruptions to youth mental health to bolster youth resilience during these unprecedented times.

However, the current study uses longitudinal data to show that the pandemic, and the subsequent shutdown efforts, are also having significant impacts on the mental health of adolescents. By identifying specific elements of the societal shutdown that are most associated with changes in mental health trajectories over time, we hope to encourage the development of social capital that can assist youth in fostering resilience in the face of these stressors.",JAN 2022,77,2022,2021-05-24,JAN,Journal,N,0003-066X,1935-990X,10.1037/amp0000838,NA,MEDLINE:34110880,NA,NA,NA,AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST,The Mental Health Implications of COVID-19 for Adolescents: Follow-Up of a Four-Wave Longitudinal Study During the Pandemic,AM PSYCHOL,Am.

Yet, it is not clear whether threat overgeneralization reflects general discrimination deficits, or rather a specific bias related to aversive stimuli. Here we tested this question and characterized the neural correlates of threat discrimination. Methods One-hundred and eight participants (33 PTSD; 43 trauma-exposed controls; 32 healthy controls) completed an emotionally neutral complex shape discrimination task involving identifying in 42 similar pairs the previously observed shape; and an emotionally aversive discrimination task, involving providing risk ratings for an aversive conditioned stimulus (CS+), and for several stimuli gradually differing in size from the original CS+. Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) was collected before completing the tasks. Results No group differences emerged on the emotionally neutral task. Conversely, on the emotionally aversive task, individuals with PTSD had steeper linear risk rating slopes as the stimuli more resembled the conditioned stimulus. Finally, lower rsFC of amygdala-default mode network (DMN) and DMN-salience network (SN) were associated with steeper risk slopes, while for hippocampus-SN, lower rsFC was found only among participants with PTSD. Conclusions Individuals with PTSD show deficits in discrimination only when presented with aversive stimuli.

Extending this line of research, we integrate signaling theory with a view of social networks as ""prisms,"" to demonstrate the relevance of employees' network ties in the work unit for delegation. Signaling theory argues that when direct data about employee competence are mixed or ambiguous, decision makers will look for more indirect signals with which to make inferences about quality and reputation. One such signal is suggested by the networks as ""prisms"" perspective, which argues that network ties can operate as reputational signals in the absence of more direct quality data. Combining these insights and data from a field study and two follow-up laboratory studies, we find that in situations of moderate employee competence, managers will draw positive reputational inferences and be more willing to delegate to employees when such employees are more central in the friendship network of the work unit as well as when they share common memberships in friendship cliques with the managers.

Methods Participants were 164 dyads consisting of a target child with ADHD and peer problems (age 6-11 years; 68% male; and 73% white) and a reciprocated friend. Dyads were observed in the lab during a cooperative task eliciting verbal negotiation processes to decide how to share a limited resource and during a fast-paced, engrossing, and competitive task. Both tasks were designed to mirror the real-world interactions of friends. Sequences of dyadic mutuality (i.e., reciprocity of positive affect and positive behaviors) and coercive joining (i.e., reciprocity of aggressive, controlling, and rule-breaking behaviors) between target children and friends were coded. Results Regarding dyadic mutuality, target children reciprocated their friends' positive affect in both tasks. They also reciprocated their friends' positive behaviors but only in the cooperative task. In contrast, they only reciprocated their friends' coercive joining behaviors in the competitive task. Medium to large reciprocity effects was found for 36%-53% (dyadic mutuality) and 38%-55% (coercive joining) of target children. Conclusions These results extend findings of peer contagion processes to the friendships of children with ADHD and suggest that contagion may vary according to interaction context (i.e., competition vs. cooperation). Understanding the spread of peer contagion may illuminate how children with ADHD and their friends influence each other's adjustment over time and may guide friendship-focused psychosocial interventions for this population.",DEC 2022,63,2022,2022-03-01,DEC,Journal,N,0021-9630,1469-7610,10.1111/jcpp.13597,NA,MEDLINE:35233788,NA,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY,Peer contagion dynamics in the friendships of children with ADHD,J CHILD PSYCHOL PSYC,J.

Policymakers are keen to understand which investments have contributed to this. We evaluated the association between Ethiopia's Health Extension Program (HEP) and 12 adolescent health and wellbeing outcomes.Methods: We used Young Lives Ethiopia cohort data between 2002 and 2013. We evaluated associ-ations between household support from HEP at age 15 and 12 adolescent outcomes spread across health, gender-based violence, education, and employment at age 19 using the inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score approach, stratifying by sex. Adjusted probability differences (APDs) and adjusted mean differences (AMDs) were used to contrast exposure to HEP versus no exposure.Results: Of 775 adolescents with complete follow-up, 46% were female. Sixty-six percent of ad-olescents reported support from HEP, with higher rates of support in poorer, less educated, and rural households, particularly in Tigray Province. In boys, HEP was positively associated with ed-ucation enrolment (APD: +20 percentage points [ppts], 95% confidence interval [CI]: +9 ppts, +31 ppts) and literacy (AMD: +6 ppts, 95% CI: +0.2, +11), and negatively associated with >4 hours in income-generating activities per day (APD:-19 ppts, 95% CI:-30 ppts,-9 ppts). In girls, HEP was positively associated with no child marriage (APD: +16 ppts, 95% CI: +4 ppts, +27 ppts), no adolescent pregnancy (APD: +17 ppts, 95% CI: +6 ppts, +28 ppts), education enrolment (APD: +27 ppts, 95% CI: +15 ppts, +39 ppts), literacy (AMD: +5 ppts, 95% CI: +0.2, +11), and numeracy (AMD: +8 ppts, 95% CI: +3; +13).Discussion: Policies promoting HEP are likely to have supported improvements in multiple areas of adolescents' lives in Ethiopia.(c) 2022 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

However, knowledge of trauma-related avoidance has been limited by conceptualization of this construct as unifactorial and consisting of only two components. The Posttraumatic Avoidance Behaviour Questionnaire (PABQ; van Minnen & Hagenaars, 2010) was developed to assess distinct domains of avoidance. Method: The current study expanded upon one prior psychometric study of the PABQ by examining the internal consistency and construct validity of the PABQ among a sample of 177 treatment-seeking adults diagnosed with PTSD. Results: Results indicated that the psychometric properties vary by PABQ subscale. Although all subscales demonstrated adequate internal consistency, items that appear to be negatively impacting internal consistency were identified for several subscales. Although correlations between PABQ subscales indicate subscales index distinct dimensions of trauma-related avoidance, observed similar associations with external correlates suggest these subscales may not functionally differ in their association with PTSD symptoms and cooccurring psychopathology. Accordingly, results suggest further construct validity evidence is needed to determine whether. despite potentially representing distinct domains of avoidance, avoidance of different forms of trauma-related stimuli predicts functionally distinct outcomes. Conclusions: Collectively, our results indicate that the PABQ is a potentially promising measure for assessing trauma-related avoidance behavior, although additional research is needed to better understand the degree to which these hypothesized distinct domains of avoidance behaviors represent meaningfully distinct constructs.",MAR 2022,14,2022,2021-08-16,MAR,Journal,N,1942-9681,1942-969X,10.1037/tra0001060,NA,MEDLINE:34398628,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY,Psychometric Properties of the Posttraumatic Avoidance Behaviour Questionnaire Among a Treatment-Seeking Adult Sample,PSYCHOL TRAUMA-US,Psychol.

In this sample, clinicians may benefit from focusing on patients reporting (a) more than 10 traumatic event (TE) types and (b) more than 2 directly experienced TEs; these patients may be at risk for clinically significant posttrauma psychopathology such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Broadly, study findings are an initial step in assisting researchers, clinicians, and policymakers who seek to improve mental health treatment for Indian military personnel.
Objective: Traumatic event (TE) types have been shown to relate to adverse psychological outcomes. However, research in this area has relied almost exclusively on linear analysis and has been limited to Western countries with similar cultural values. Addressing these limitations, this study examined (a) presence and nature of relations between number of TE types and psychological outcomes and (b) minimum number of TE types predicting psychological symptoms in a culturally distinct sample of ex-military members from India. Method: The sample of 144 trauma-exposed Indian ex-military members (M-age = 43.49; 90.90% males) completed a web-based survey. Results: Curvilinear regression analyses indicated quadratic relationships between number of TE types and psychological symptoms (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], depression, and anxiety severity) and resilience. Exploratory analyses showed (a) linear relationships between number of directly experienced TE types and psychological outcomes, (b) quadratic relationships between number of Predominant Death Threat TEs and psychological symptoms, (c) linear relationship between number of Predominant Death Threat TEs and resilience, and (d) linear relationships between other TE categories and psychological outcomes. Nonparametric receiver operating characteristic curve analyses indicated that a threshold of at least 10.5 TE types provided the optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity in classifying participants with (vs. without) probable PTSD, depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. For those reporting directly experienced TE types, this threshold was 2.5-3.5 TE types. Conclusion: Study results enhance an understanding of psychological difficulties faced by Indian ex-military members who have experienced multiple TE types, which can inform psychotherapeutic treatments for this population.",MAR 2022,14,2022,2022-03-01,MAR,Journal,N,1942-9681,1942-969X,10.1037/tra0001050,NA,MEDLINE:35175085,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY,"The Relationship Between Number of Trauma Types, Resilience, and Psychological Symptoms in Ex-Military Personnel From India",PSYCHOL TRAUMA-US,Psychol.

Correlation, moderation, and mediation analyses were conducted to determine relationships between variables. Results: Flood survivors experienced both PTSS and PTG. Additionally, event exposure directly facilitated PTG. Further, SBP influenced PTG both directly and by its role in reducing PTSS. Finally, higher levels of SBP aided individuals in converting PTSS into PTG. Conclusions: Favorable psychological outcomes following floods are not uncommon even for those with high levels of stress or exposure. Individual- and community-level interventions should leverage facilitating factors such as SBP to promote growth outcomes such as PTG.

Research suggests intergenerational risk associated with trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such that maternal trauma experiences and related symptoms can negatively impact child outcomes across development. The goals of the present study were to examine child and mother correlates of child PTSD symptoms and the unique roles of child and maternal emotion dysregulation in understanding child PTSD symptoms. Method: Subjects included 105 African American mother-child dyads from an urban hospital serving primarily low-income minority individuals. Results: Correlational results showed that child trauma exposure, child emotion dysregulation, maternal depressive symptoms, maternal emotion dysregulation, and potential for maternal child abuse all were significantly associated with child PTSD symptoms (ps < 0.05). Hierarchical linear regression models revealed that child trauma exposure, maternal depression, and maternal abuse potential accounted for 29% of the variance in child PTSD symptoms (p < 0.001). Both child emotion dysregulation (R-change(2) = 0.14, p < .001) and maternal emotion dysregulation (R-change(2) = 0.04, p < .05) were significantly associated with child PTSD symptoms independent of other risk factors and potential for maternal abuse was no longer a significant predictor. Conclusions: These results suggest that maternal emotion dysregulation may be an important factor in influencing their child's PTSD symptoms above and beyond child-specific variables. Both maternal and child emotion dysregulation could be valuable treatment targets for improving maternal mental health and parenting behaviors and bolstering child health outcomes, thus reducing intergenerational transmission of risk associated with trauma.",OCT 2022,14,2022,2022-10-01,OCT,Journal,N,1942-9681,1942-969X,10.1037/tra0000543,NA,MEDLINE:31894989,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY,Intergenerational Transmission of Risk for PTSD Symptoms in African American Children: The Roles of Maternal and Child Emotion Dysregulation,PSYCHOL TRAUMA-US,Psychol.

With the increase in average life expectancy, these tend to co-occur, which may increase the psychological distress (PD) of seniors. Resilience has been shown to be an important protective factor of seniors mental health, although its potential buffering role of public health risk factors with cumulative impact on mental health, such as loneliness and ageism, needs to be more studied. Aim: To assess the potential mediator role of resilience between the effects of ageism and loneliness on PD in seniors. Methods: A sam-ple of 349 Portuguese seniors aged 60 years and over was collected through an online survey and during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Seniors completed the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6), the Short-Form of UCLA Loneliness Scale (USL-6), the Ambivalent Ageism Scale (AAS) and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10). A mediation analysis model was developed with resilience as a mediating variable. Results: There were moderate to high levels of PD and moderate levels of ageism, loneliness and resilience. Resilience fully mediated the effect of age-ism on PD and partially mediated the effect of loneliness on PD. Conclusions: Resilience was an important protective factor of mental health against the effects of ageism, and partially pro-tected mental health from the effects of loneliness among seniors. It is suggested that resilience be considered as a factor to be integrated in future intervention programs for mental health. The practical applicability of this study is discussed.

On average, individual differences in relationship satisfaction were highly stable over time (r = .76, corrected for attenuation due to measurement error and based on an average time lag of 2.30 years). Rank-order stability varied systematically as a function of age, increasing from young to late adulthood with a slight decline during middle adulthood. Rank-order stability also varied as a function of relationship duration, increasing over the course of the relationship with a slight decline around 20 years of relationship duration. Moderator analyses suggested that relationship transitions shortly before Time 1 and sample type explained variance in rank-order stability. However, except for these two moderators, the pattern of findings was robust across all characteristics tested. In sum, this meta-analysis indicates that relationship satisfaction is a relatively stable construct, with lower stabilities in young adulthood and in the first years after beginning a relationship.

In the present research, we used data from the NSLM to examine moderation by teachers' mindsets and answer a new question: Can students independently implement their growth mindsets in virtually any classroom culture, or must students' growth mindsets be supported by their teacher's own growth mindsets (i.e., the mindset-plus-supportive-context hypothesis)? The present analysis (9,167 student records matched with 223 math teachers) supported the latter hypothesis.

Bayesian Networks are probabilistic graphical models that represent conditional independence relationships among variables as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where edges can be interpreted as causal effects connecting one causal symptom to an effect symptom. These models can help overcome one of the key limitations of partial correlation networks whose edges are undirected.

We aimed to evaluate the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using a mixed-methods design. Methods This longitudinal study drew from a preexisting sample of 957 adults living in Soweto, a major township near Johannesburg. Psychological assessments were administered across two waves between August 2019 and March 2020 and during the first 6 weeks of the lockdown (late March-early May 2020). Interviews on COVID-19 experiences were administered in the second wave. Multiple regression models examined relationships between perceived COVID-19 risk and depression. Results Full data on perceived COVID-19 risk, depression, and covariates were available in 221 adults. In total, 14.5% of adults were at risk for depression. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk predicted greater depressive symptoms (p < 0.001), particularly among adults with histories of childhood trauma, though this effect was marginally significant (p = 0.063). Adults were about two times more likely to experience significant depressive symptoms for every one unit increase in perceived COVID-19 risk (p = 0.021; 95% CI 1.10-3.39). Qualitative data identified potent experiences of anxiety, financial insecurity, fear of infection, and rumination.

A sample of 984 Australian emerging adults (M age = 20.55, SD = 2.19, range: 18-25) completed an online survey including measures of demographics, substance use, environmental variables (perceived drinking by parents/peers), and cognitive variables (AOEs and DRSE). This study employed a cross-sectional design. Path analysis was used to identify indirect pathways for the relationship between environmental factors and drinking behaviour, through cognitive variables. In line with the predicted model, the relationship between parental drinking and problem drinking was sequentially mediated by AOEs, and then DRSE. Participants with heavier drinking parents reported higher AOEs (positive and negative), which related to having lower DRSE, and higher problem drinking. Similarly, the positive relationship between peer drinking and problem drinking was mediated by having higher positive and negative expectancies, but contrary to predictions, DRSE did not mediate these pathways.

This study also investigates whether this relationship varies by gender. Methods Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the present study employed a sibling fixed effect approach that takes into account unobserved family background factors such as genetics and social environments. Gender-stratified analyses were conducted to consider the potential gendered relationship between adolescent sleep and educational attainment. Results Controlling for unobserved family-level heterogeneity attenuated the associations between adolescent sleep characteristics and educational attainment, albeit in different ways for boys and girls. Gender-stratified models suggest that, for boys, only the association between short sleep duration and educational attainment was robust to adjustment for sibling fixed effects. In contrast, for girls, among three sleep quality measures, only trouble falling or staying asleep remained significantly associated with educational attainment even after controlling for unobserved family heterogeneity. Sibling fixed effects estimates suggest that short sleep duration (6 or fewer hours per night) was negatively associated with years of schooling only among boys (b = -0.443), whereas trouble falling or staying asleep was associated with a reduction in years of schooling only among girls (b = -0.556). The mechanisms underlying the observed associations also differed by gender. For boys, the association between short sleep duration and educational attainment was partially explained by a combination of educational, social, and psychological factors. Only intermediate educational factors explained part of the association between trouble falling or staying asleep and educational attachment among girls.

The current study uses in-depth interviews to examine post-retirement working among Israeli doctors who have retired over the past few years but continue to work. The findings show that doctors have difficulty shedding their professional identity since the medical profession was, and still is, central to their overall identity. They thus experience retirement as a forced event rather than a desirable transition. However, by continuing to work, they preserve their status as doctors, which imparts a feeling of still being needed and thus enhances their self-image.

Methods In the current study, segmentation of amygdala and hippocampal sub-regions was used to investigate the longitudinal changes of volume, the relationship between volume and antidepressant effects, and prediction performances for ECT in MDD patients before and after ECT using two independent datasets. Results As a result, MDD patients showed selectively and consistently increased volume in the left lateral nucleus, right accessory basal nucleus, bilateral basal nucleus, bilateral corticoamygdaloid transition (CAT), bilateral paralaminar nucleus of the amygdala, and bilateral hippocampus-amygdala transition area (HATA) after ECT in both datasets, whereas marginally significant increase of volume in bilateral granule cell molecular layer of the head of dentate gyrus, the bilateral head of cornu ammonis (CA) 4, and left head of CA 3. Correlation analyses revealed that increased volume of left HATA was significantly associated with antidepressant effects after ECT. Moreover, volumes of HATA in the MDD patients before ECT could be served as potential biomarkers to predict ECT remission with the highest accuracy of 86.95% and 82.92% in two datasets (The predictive models were trained on Dataset 2 and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of Dataset 2 were obtained from leave-one-out-cross-validation. Thus, they were not independent and very likely to be inflated).

Three themes emerged, including menstrual health, menstrual stigma, and menstrual positivity. Tweets related to menstrual health included physical complications, sexual/reproductive health, health education, and LGBTQ health. Tweets that addressed menstrual stigma included inconvenience/limitations, shame/stereotypes, religion/alternate perceptions, access/affordability, and self-depreciation/harm. Tweets related to menstrual positivity included awareness/community, strength/resilience, and environment/sustainability.Discussion: This study provides insights into youth perceptions about menstruation. There was overwhelming emphasis placed on the negative expectations and shame around menstruation. A significant minority of tweets were directly or indirectly related to advocacy or education, which supports the potential use of Twitter as a platform to improve public health messaging, transform health outcomes, and promote equity among youth who menstruate.(c) 2022 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Faultlines can split a board based on the alignment of multiple attributes of individual directors and potentially create subgroups within the board. In this study, we argue that different types of faultlines have distinct effects on board decision-making. Specifically, we predict that demographic faultlines can increase conflicts among directors, hampering the board's ability to decide on CEO dismissal when firm performance is below the aspiration level. On the other hand, information-based faultlines can facilitate exchange of diverse knowledge and elaboration of alternative perspectives, which can improve the board's ability to dismiss a CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level. Our analysis of S&P 500 boards supports our prediction that board faultlines based on demographic attributes of directors significantly reduce the board's ability to fire the CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level, whereas faultlines based on information-related attributes magnify the board's ability to dismiss a poor-performing CEO. By demonstrating different effects of faultlines based on heterogenous types of director attributes, this study contributes to the board faultline literature. We also contribute to CEO dismissal research by showing how group dynamics of boards moderates the relationship between firm performance and CEO dismissal.",APR 2023,49,2023,2022-04-13,APR,Journal,N,0149-2063,1557-1211,10.1177/01492063221083889,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT,Faults and Faultlines: The Effects of Board Faultlines on CEO Dismissal,J MANAGE,J.

Participants were randomized to one of the three groups (8-week GT, 8-week ESH, or WL). Participants in all three groups were assessed at baseline and after treatment (week 9 for the WL group). The two treatment groups were additionally assessed at one month and six months after the intervention. Treatment effects were examined using linear mixed models.Results: A total of 135 youths (mean age: 20.0 f 2.5 years, female: 67.4%) were recruited. After treatment, both active treatment groups showed significant improvements in insomnia symptoms (GT vs. WL: Cohen's d =-1.03, ESH vs. WL: d =-.63), less presleep arousal (d =-.52 to-1.47), less sleep-related dysfunctional belief (d =-.88 to-1.78), better sleep hygiene practice (d =-.79 to-.84), and improved daytime functioning (d =-.56 to-.96) compared with the WL group. In addition, GT outperformed ESH in improving maladaptive sleep-related beliefs and mood symptoms at posttreatment and 6-month follow-up. A reduction of suicidality with moderate effect size favoring GT emerged at 6-month follow-up.Discussion: Our findings suggested that both group-based and email-delivered CBT-I were effective in treating youth insomnia, but group-based CBT-I showed superior effects on reducing maladaptive beliefs and mood symptoms.

Guidelines recommend a careful evaluation of developmental history when assessing the disorders, but it is unclear how children with ADHD and ASD differ from their peers growing up. In this study, physical, family, psychological, social, and educational information were examined in 3623 ethnically diverse children that were prospectively followed from birth to age 15 as part of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Fifteen-thousand variables were screened, and 506 variables included in the final analyses. Accuracy of the most indicative information to predict ADHD and ASD diagnoses in adolescence was evaluated. Adolescents with ADHD (n = 627) and ASD (n = 91) differed from their peers on a plethora of developmental signs, with signs closely related to the core symptoms of the disorders after age 5 being most indicative of the disorders. Predictive models correctly identified 66% of individuals with ADHD and 81% of those with ASD, but 62-88% of identified cases were false positives. The mean proportion of developmental deviations was 18.7% in the ADHD group, 20.0% in the ASD group, and 15.6% in peers; youth with both ADHD and ASD (n = 50) deviated on 21.8% of all developmental signs and had more pronounced deviations than those with ADHD or ASD alone. ADHD and ASD are characterized by broad and non-specific developmental deviations. Developmental information alone cannot be used to accurately predict diagnostic status in adolescence and false positives are likely if the diagnostic process relies heavily on such information. Developmental deviations are part of normal development and common in children without ADHD and ASD. Etiological heterogeneity and considerable temporal fluctuation in the core characteristics of ADHD and ASD may explain the lack of distinct developmental patterns.",NA,NA,2022,2022-06-24,JUN 24,Journal,N,1018-8827,1435-165X,10.1007/s00787-022-02024-4,NA,MEDLINE:35748938,NA,NA,NA,EUROPEAN CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY,Developmental signs of ADHD and autism: a prospective investigation in 3623 children,EUR CHILD ADOLES PSY,Eur.

This assumption is also implicit in empirical work that emphasizes links between language input and learning outcomes. However, models have typically focused on average performance, whereas empirical work has focused on variability. To model individual variability, we relate the tradition of research on accumulator models to item response theory models from psychometrics.

Recent research however has not observed consistent racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic stress in the early aftermath of trauma, suggesting that such differences in chronic PTSD rates may be related to differences in recovery over time. Methods As part of the multisite, longitudinal AURORA study, we investigated racial/ethnic differences in PTSD and related outcomes within 3 months after trauma. Participants (n = 930) were recruited from emergency departments across the USA and provided periodic (2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months after trauma) self-report assessments of PTSD, depression, dissociation, anxiety, and resilience. Linear models were completed to investigate racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic dysfunction with subsequent follow-up models assessing potential effects of prior life stressors. Results Racial/ethnic groups did not differ in symptoms over time; however, Black participants showed reduced posttraumatic depression and anxiety symptoms overall compared to Hispanic participants and White participants. Racial/ethnic differences were not attenuated after accounting for differences in sociodemographic factors. However, racial/ethnic differences in depression and anxiety were no longer significant after accounting for greater prior trauma exposure and childhood emotional abuse in White participants. Conclusions The present findings suggest prior differences in previous trauma exposure partially mediate the observed racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic depression and anxiety symptoms following a recent trauma.

We propose that supervisors are also a key piece of this puzzle: Supervisors who are more successful in their own pursuit of passion place more value on passion in their performance evaluations. This produces an interpersonal dynamic whereby employees who are more successful in pursuing their passion may receive higher performance ratings when their supervisors are also more successful in pursuing their passion. We provide support for this core hypothesis across a crowdsourced study with a heterogeneous sample (N = 106 subordinate-supervisor dyads), a field study with a financial services company (N = 321 subordinate-supervisor dyads), and a laboratory experiment (N = 205) that offers both causal and mediating evidence. Crucially, we demonstrate that this interpersonal dynamic is specific to passion and does not apply to less observable motivations (intrinsic and extrinsic motivation).

Their results showed, however, that average self-reported states did not predict global informant-reported personality above and beyond global self-reports. In this research, we aimed at replicating and extending these results. We used data of five studies (total N = 806) that involved global self- and informant-reports and employed a variety of different experience-sampling methods (time-based with different sampling schedules, event-based). Across all studies, the original results (i.e., no incremental effects of average self-reported states) were replicated. Furthermore, as an extension to the original study, we found that average other-reported states (provided by peers, results based on one study) did indeed predict global informant-reports above and beyond global self-reports. These findings highlight the importance of differentiating between method effects (global reports vs. average states) from source of information effects (self vs. other). We discuss these results, focusing on the suitability of using informant-reports as a criterion variable and conceptual differences between assessment methods.",SEP 2022,123,2022,2022-02-03,SEP,Journal,N,0022-3514,1939-1315,10.1037/pspp0000408,NA,MEDLINE:35113627,NA,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,The Incremental Validity of Average States: A Replication and Extension of Finnigan and Vazire (2018),J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

To understand risk and protective factors for PTSD during the transition into civilian life, this study examined demographic, experiential, and psychosocial characteristics that may explain variation in PTSD symptoms and timing of onset. Method: A nationwide sample representing 48,965 U.S. veterans separating from military service in fall 2016 responded to six Web-based surveys over 3 years. Assessments included PTSD symptoms, stress, warfare exposures, military sexual trauma, moral injury events, resilience, and social support. Multivariable models estimated covariates of positive PTSD screen or symptoms. Results: Trauma exposure during military service was high at 59%. Probable PTSD was detected in 26% of the sample at baseline, with additional cases in each survey wave for an overall rate of 30%. Meeting criteria for probable PTSD covaried with current stress, female gender, and minority race/ethnicity; baseline psychological resilience and concurrent social support mitigated the risk. PTSD symptoms correlated positively with stress levels at current and previous time points. Social support was protective but only when contemporaneous with the PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: This study illustrates the need for ongoing social support for veterans coping with symptoms of PTSD, life stressors, and postmilitary trauma, suggesting a countervailing influence of psychological resilience and contemporaneous (but not historical) social support on symptom exacerbation.

Embedding our study in a person-in-situation creativity research stream, we introduce employee-experienced crisis, defined as the impact an employee experiences from crisis event(s) in a team, and examine its interaction with implicit theories (i.e., a fixed vs. a growth mindset) in employee creativity. We hypothesize that an employee-experienced crisis stifles employee creativity via increased job anxiety when the individual possesses a strong fixed mindset. In contrast, the same phenomenon stimulates creativity via enhanced creative process engagement when the individual has a strong growth mindset. In Study 1, we collected multisource, time-lagged field data from 506 employees working in 107 research and development (R&D) teams. The results supported our hypotheses. To further explore how the moderating effects of mindsets occur, we conducted Study 2, another multisource, time-lagged field study of 260 employees in 40 R&D teams.

Psychedelic drugs such as LSD have been suggested to have therapeutic actions through their effects on learning. The behavioural effects of LSD in humans, however, remain incompletely understood. Here we examined how LSD affects probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) in healthy humans. MethodsHealthy volunteers received intravenous LSD (75 mu g in 10 mL saline) or placebo (10 mL saline) in a within-subjects design and completed a PRL task. Participants had to learn through trial and error which of three stimuli was rewarded most of the time, and these contingencies switched in a reversal phase. Computational models of reinforcement learning (RL) were fitted to the behavioural data to assess how LSD affected the updating ('learning rates') and deployment of value representations ('reinforcement sensitivity') during choice, as well as 'stimulus stickiness' (choice repetition irrespective of reinforcement history). ResultsRaw data measures assessing sensitivity to immediate feedback ('win-stay' and 'lose-shift' probabilities) were unaffected, whereas LSD increased the impact of the strength of initial learning on perseveration. Computational modelling revealed that the most pronounced effect of LSD was the enhancement of the reward learning rate. The punishment learning rate was also elevated. Stimulus stickiness was decreased by LSD, reflecting heightened exploration. Reinforcement sensitivity differed by phase.

A major obstacle in understanding and treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is its clinical and neurobiological heterogeneity. To address this barrier, the field has become increasingly interested in identifying subtypes of PTSD based on dysfunction in neural networks alongside cognitive impairments that may underlie the development and maintenance of symptoms. The current study aimed to determine if subtypes of PTSD, based on normative-based cognitive dysfunction across multiple domains, have unique neural network signatures.
Methods. In a sample of 271 veterans (90% male) that completed both neuropsychological testing and resting-state fMRI, two complementary, whole-brain functional connectivity analyses explored the link between brain functioning, PTSD symptoms, and cognition.
Results. At the network level, PTSD symptom severity was associated with reduced negative coupling between the limbic network (LN) and frontal-parietal control network (FPCN), driven specifically by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala Hubs of Dysfunction. Further, this relationship was uniquely moderated by executive function (EF). Specifically, those with PTSD and impaired EF had the strongest marker of LN-FPCN dysregulation, while those with above-average EF did not exhibit PTSD-related dysregulation of these networks.
Conclusion.

Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. A list of emotional states was compared in HCW and non-HCW and within HCW roles. The relationship between COVID-19 related symptoms, information, and protective measures and the emotional state was analyzed. Results: Fear (p < .001, phi(c) = .11), irritability (p = .001, phi(c) = .08), frustration (p < .001, phi(c) = .10), anger (p = .013, phi(c) = .06), and helplessness (p < .001, phi(c) = .13) appear significantly more frequently in HCW compared to non-HCW. Within HCW, a higher percentage of physicians, especially the less experienced, significantly perceived uncertainty and frustration (p = .001, phi(c) = .13 and p = .025, phi(c) = .10, respectively), while a higher percentage of nurses significantly experienced sadness (p = .024, phi(c) = .10). Having a confirmatory diagnosis of the disease was related to hypochondria sensation (p = .026, phi(c) = .10). Sadness (p = .035, phi(c) = .09), intolerance (p = .058, phi(c) = .09), anger (p = .024, phi(c) = .10), and helplessness (p = .028, phi(c) = .10) appeared as the most relevant emotions when information was perceived as insufficient. Conclusions: The knowledge of the most prevalent different emotional patterns in HCW, as well as in the general population, will allow the detection of subjects at risk for the development of mental disorders and the implementation of therapeutic approaches in future similar situations of pandemic or outbreak of the current one.
Clinical Impact Statement During the current health crisis, diverse feelings have arisen in response to the threat that the outbreak has posed, especially for health care workers. With the aim of evaluating the emotional response and its relationship with COVID-19, we have interviewed health care and non-health care workers in Spain during the peak of the pandemic. Our results show that 1) fear, irritability, frustration, anger, and helplessness appeared more frequently in HCW; 2) trainees perceived more uncertainty and frustration than experienced physicians; 3) nursing staff were more likely to experience sadness; 4) having a COVID confirmatory diagnosis was related to hypochondria; and, 5) sadness, intolerance, anger, and helplessness appeared when perceived information was insufficient.",FEB 2022,14,2022,2021-03-04,FEB,Journal,N,1942-9681,1942-969X,10.1037/tra0001024,NA,MEDLINE:33661693,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY,Different Emotional Profile of Health Care Staff and General Population During the COVID-19 Outbreak,PSYCHOL TRAUMA-US,Psychol.

The literature that exists suggests that autistic parents can find it difficult to manage the everyday demands of parenting and domestic life. While emerging research has also highlighted more positive parenting experiences, greater understanding of autistic parenthood is needed.Objective: This study sought to understand autistic parents' parenting experiences during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: Thirty-five Australian autistic parents (95% women) of autistic children (aged 4-25 years) took part in semi-structured interviews designed to elicit their experiences of life during lockdown. We used reflexive thematic analysis using an inductive (bottom-up) approach to identify patterned meanings within the data set.Results: Autistic parents repeatedly spoke of how the lockdown brought some initial relief from the intensity of their usual lives caring for their children. Nevertheless, most autistic parents felt that the ""cumulative stress"" of trying to juggle everything during lockdown proved very challenging, which eventually took its toll on parents' mental health. Parents were aware that they needed support but found it difficult to reach out to their usual social supports (including autistic friends) for help, and formal supports were virtually nonexistent. Consequently, they felt ""very much forgotten."" Nevertheless, they described how their connections with their children grew stronger over lockdown as they focused on nurturing their children's ""mental health ahead of everything else.""Conclusions: Our analysis shows how challenging conventional life can be for autistic parents. Parenting requires grappling with a distinctive set of demands, which are usually partially manageable through the informal supports many autistic parents draw upon. The relative absence of informal supports during the pandemic, however, left them reliant on more formal supports, which were not forthcoming. Research is urgently needed to identify the most effective formal supports for autistic parents, ideally in partnership with autistic parents themselves.
Community brief Why is this an important issue?There is very little research about what autistic parents think about being a parent and how they manage in their everyday lives. What was the purpose of this study?We, a group of autistic and non-autistic researchers, worked together to look at autistic people's experiences of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, led by an autistic parent, we focused on understanding what parenting was like for autistic parents during this time. What did we do?We spoke to 35 autistic parents, mostly from Australia, about their experiences of life during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Almost all parents were women. They each spoke to us for about 1 hour. We discussed questions like, ""What has been difficult for your child about being required to stay at home? And what has been positive about it? What about you? How have you found having to stay at home?"" What were the results of the study?Autistic parents told us that life before COVID-19 could ""be really hard."" Their days were spent focusing on their children and supporting them, but they felt life became a bit simpler during lockdown. They also did not have ""to go out in the non-autistic world,"" which they found exhausting. But lockdown made things difficult, too. Autistic parents told us that they were stressed about trying to juggle everything at home, such as home learning, working from home, and cleaning the house. They also felt that they were the ones supporting everyone else. This meant they did not get the rest they needed. They were also worried about COVID-19. These worries and pressure often had a terrible effect on autistic parents' mental health. They wanted to reach out to their friends-especially autistic friends-for help but often could not. There were few other supports available to help them. Even when things were difficult, they told us that they nonetheless felt connected with their children during lockdown and that they were putting their children's mental health first, above everything else. What do these findings add to what was already known?This study shows how hard everyday life can be for autistic parents. These parents usually rely on their friends for support. But they could not do that during lockdown. This meant they had to get help from more official supports and services. But these often just were not available. As a result, autistic parents felt ""very much forgotten"" as a group. What are potential weaknesses in the study?Most of our participants were women, well educated, and White. We do not know if our autistic parents' experiences would be the same for other autistic parents, such as autistic fathers or those from other racial/ethnic backgrounds. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future?These findings show how important it is to understand how we can support autistic parents and make their lives better during times of crisis and in more normal times. This needs to be done in partnership with autistic parents.",MAR 1 2023,5,2023,2022-05-12,MAR 1,Journal,N,2573-9581,2573-959X,10.1089/aut.2021.0097,NA,MEDLINE:36941857,NA,NA,NA,AUTISM IN ADULTHOOD,"""I'm the Family Ringmaster and Juggler"": Autistic Parents' Experiences of Parenting During the COVID-19 Pandemic",AUTISM ADULTHOOD,Autism Adulthood,AUTISM ADUL,AUTISM ADULTHOOD,1,publisher,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",1,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",AUTISM IN ADULTHOOD

Participants of this longitudinal study aged 65+ from German-speaking Europe completed an online questionnaire about their PA, fear of Covid-19, and HAPA factors in April and May 2020. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regressions. Results showed that moderate to vigorous activity (MVPA) remained stable after lockdown and that self-efficacy most robustly influenced the intention to be active. PA was not explained by any volitional factor but was strongly related to past PA. Interestingly, the relationship of past and future MVPA was attenuated by fear of Covid-19, but this finding was not robust when outliers were removed.

However, evidence-based treatments designed for Chinese children are scarce. This study aimed to test the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral program (Power up Children's Psychological Immunity; PCPI) in Chinese children. Method: A total of 87 children with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in grades 3 to 5 were randomly allocated (1:1) to the PCPI group or the treatment as usual (TAU) group. The feasibility was assessed by participant adherence, satisfaction, and acceptability. The severity of PTSD, depression and anxiety were assessed at pre- and posttreatment and the 3-month follow-up. Results: A high level of satisfaction (81.82%) and retention rate of each session (more than 93.33%) were found. Qualitative feedback reported a high level of acceptance. At posttreatment, the PCPI group had lower mean scores than the TAU group for PTSD (adjusted mean difference [AMD], -6.18; 95% CI, -12.21 to -.14; p = .048), and anxiety (AMD, -2.05; 95% CI, -3.81 to -.28; p = .026).

This study aimed to examine the extent to which mother-to-infant bonding predicted infant development in a multi-wave longitudinal pregnancy cohort study (N = 1,347).
Method: Self-reported bonding was assessed using the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale at each trimester, and the Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale at 8 weeks and 12 months postpartum. Infant development was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III) at 12 months.
Results: Bonding predicted indicators of infant social-affective development, including social-emotional, behavioral, and temperamental outcomes. Effect sizes ranged from small to moderate, increasing over the perinatal period (beta= 0.11-0.27). Very small effects were also identified in the relationship between bonding and cognitive, language, and motor development (beta = 0.06-0.08).
Conclusion: Findings suggest that a mother's perceived emotional connection with her child plays a role in predicting social-affective outcomes; prediction may not extend to other domains of infant development.

Genetic liability for many common psychiatric disorders often confers transdiagnostic risk to develop a wide variety of psychopathological symptoms through yet unknown pathways. This study examined the psychological and cognitive pathways that might mediate the relationship between genetic liability (indexed by polygenic scores; PS) and broad psychopathology (indexed by p factor and its underlying dimensions).
Method: First, which of the common psychiatric PSs (major depressive disorder [MDD], attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism) that were associated with p factor were identified. Then focused was shifted to 3 pathways: punishment sensitivity (reflected by behavioral inhibition system), reward sensitivity (reflected by behavioral activation system), and cognitive abilities (reflected by g factor based on 10 neurocognitive tasks). We applied structural equation modeling on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study dataset (n = 4,814; 2,263 girls; 9-10 years old).
Results: MDD and ADHD PSs were associated with p factor. The association between MDD PS and psychopathology was partially mediated by punishment sensitivity and cognitive abilities (proportion mediated = 22.35%). Conversely, the influence of ADHD PS on psychopathology was partially mediated by reward sensitivity and cognitive abilities (proportion mediated = 30.04%). The mediating role of punishment sensitivity was specific to emotional/internalizing. The mediating role of both reward sensitivity and cognitive abilities was specific to behavioral/externalizing and neurodevelopmental dimensions of psychopathology.

Here, we assessed resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) at pre-treatment and during early treatment as a potential predictor of response to a novel attention bias modification procedure, gaze-contingent music reward therapy (GC-MRT). Methods Thirty-two adults with SAD were treated with GC-MRT. rsFC was assessed with multi-voxel pattern analysis of fMRI at pre-treatment and after 2-3 weeks. For comparison, 20 healthy control (HC) participants without treatment were assessed twice for rsFC over the same time period. All SAD participants underwent clinical evaluation at pre-treatment, early-treatment (week 2-3), and post-treatment. Results SAD and depressive symptoms improved significantly from pre-treatment to post-treatment. After 2-3 weeks of treatment, decreased connectivity between the executive control network (ECN) and salience network (SN), and increased connectivity within the ECN predicted improvement in SAD and depressive symptoms at week 8. Increased connectivity between the ECN and default mode network (DMN) predicted greater improvement in SAD but not depressive symptoms at week 8. Connectivity within the DMN decreased significantly after 2-3 weeks of treatment in the SAD group, while no changes were found in HC over the same time interval. Conclusion We identified early changes in rsFC during a course of GC-MRT for SAD that predicted symptom change.

However, one major limitation of LVMs is evaluating model fit. There is no universal consensus about how to evaluate model fit, either globally or locally. Part of the reason evaluating these models is difficult is because fit is typically reduced to a handful of statistics that may or may not reflect the model's adequacy and/or assumptions. In this article we argue that proper evaluation of model fit must include visualizing both the raw data and the model-implied fit. Visuals reveal, at a glance, the fit of the model and whether the model's assumptions have been met. Unfortunately, tools for visualizing LVMs have historically been limited. In this article, we introduce new plots and reframe existing plots that provide necessary resources for evaluating LVMs. These plots are available in a new open-source R package called flexplavaan, which combines the model plotting capabilities of flexplot with the latent variable modeling capabilities of lavaan.
Translational Abstract
There is a class of models frequently used by researchers called latent variable models, or LVMs. These models are extremely flexible and useful, especially when one is trying to assess a characteristic that is ""unobserved,"" like intelligence or depression. However, historically, there have not been intuitive methods for evaluating how well these models fit the data. This article introduces a software application called ""flexplavaan,"" which makes it easy to visualize the fits of these models. flexplavaan makes it easy to identify sources of misfit and to evaluate the model's assumptions.",NA,NA,2022,2022-01-27,JAN 27,Journal,N,1082-989X,1939-1463,10.1037/met0000468,NA,MEDLINE:35084889,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS,Seeing the Impossible: Visualizing Latent Variable Models With Flexplavaan,PSYCHOL METHODS,Psychol.

We therefore performed a detailed examination of power in trials of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders. Methods We extracted data from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Mental Health). We focused on continuous efficacy outcomes and estimated power to detect predetermined effect sizes (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.20-0.80, primary SMD = 0.40) and meta-analytic effect sizes (ESMA). We performed meta-regression to estimate the influence of including underpowered studies in meta-analyses. Results We included 256 reviews with 10 686 meta-analyses and 47 384 studies. Statistical power for continuous efficacy outcomes was very low across intervention and disorder types (overall median [IQR] power for SMD = 0.40: 0.32 [0.19-0.54]; for ESMA: 0.23 [0.09-0.58]), only reaching conventionally acceptable levels (80%) for SMD = 0.80. Median power to detect the ESMA was higher in treatment-as-usual (TAU)/waitlist-controlled (0.49-0.63) or placebo-controlled (0.12-0.38) trials than in trials comparing active treatments (0.07-0.13). Adequately-powered studies produced smaller effect sizes than underpowered studies (B = -0.06, p <= 0.001). Conclusions Power to detect both predetermined and meta-analytic effect sizes in psychiatric trials was low across all interventions and disorders examined. Consistent with the presence of reporting bias, underpowered studies produced larger effect sizes than adequately-powered studies. These results emphasize the need to increase sample sizes and to reduce reporting bias against studies reporting null results to improve the reliability of the published literature.",JUL 2023,53,2023,2022-05-19,JUL,Journal,N,0033-2917,1469-8978,10.1017/S0033291722001362,NA,MEDLINE:35588241,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,"Statistical power in clinical trials of interventions for mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders",PSYCHOL MED,Psychol.

TST-R provides trauma-focused mental health treatment and addresses problems in part exacerbated by harsh U.S. immigration policies (e.g., poor mental health, stigma, fear) that have implications for the psychosocial well-being of immigrant children and families, especially those who have experienced migration-related trauma. Method: Informed by a community-based participatory research approach, TST-R was developed as an adaptation of trauma systems therapy to address common barriers to care experienced by those of refugee and immigrant backgrounds, including mental health stigma, distrust of service systems, and cultural and linguistic barriers. Results: TST-R is a multitiered and phase-based intervention that strategically addresses stressors and needs across levels of the social ecology. Most TST-R services are delivered in easily accessible, nonstigmatizing settings (e.g., school) by a cultural broker and a clinician who work in partnership. TST-R has been disseminated and implemented with multiple cultural groups (e.g., Somali, Bhutanese) across the United States and Canada. Conclusions: Given the unique stressors, strengths, and needs of immigrant children and their families, mental health services must be equitable, community based, and sustainable. TST-R demonstrates promise as a prevention and intervention model especially for those experiencing immigration policy-related stressors and may serve as a guide for developing child mental health policies and immigration policies that promote mental well-being for immigrant families.
Clinical Impact Statement Federal immigration policy can uniquely affect the mental health of immigrant children and families, both directly and indirectly. Trauma systems therapy for refugees (TST-R) is a trauma-focused, culturally responsive mental health intervention for immigrant children and families designed to address stressors, challenges, and strengths commonly experienced in their community. TST-R allows intervention focus to shift to the most significant issues for children, which include policy-related stressors when those are most salient. TST-R demonstrates promise as a sustainable, scalable, and equitable mental health model that is well suited to support the needs of immigrant children and families who have experienced migration-related trauma.",NA,NA,2022,2022-10-27,OCT 27,Journal,N,1942-9681,1942-969X,10.1037/tra0001392,NA,MEDLINE:36301293,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY,Leveraging Community-Based Mental Health Services to Reduce Inequities for Children and Families Living in United States Who Have Experienced Migration-Related Trauma,PSYCHOL TRAUMA-US,Psychol.

Across 10 studies (including an eye-tracking study and three additional studies reported in the Supporting Information Appendix), our results show that consumers perceive a smaller number of products displayed on a page when these products are separated by a dividing line compared to when they are not. This effect occurs because the dividing line separates the products into top versus bottom (or left vs. right) segments, such that participants' visual attention is largely drawn to the top (or the left) where their eyes first fixate. Consequently, participants tend to estimate the total number of items based on the subset they pay attention to. In addition, the effect is attenuated when participants' attention is directly drawn to the segment they have previously neglected and can hold regardless of line orientation.

Here, we review emerging work across the vision and social sciences to extract core principles of people perception: efficiency, capacity, and complexity. We then consider complexity in more detail, focusing on how people perception modifies person-perception processes and enables the perception of group emergent properties as well as group dynamics.

Global and local network metrics were compared within and between the networks over time. Results Global network metrics did not differ between the remitters and non-remitters at baseline or 6 months.

Hence, identifying factors that limit this acquisition may inform preventative and treatment efforts. Personality disorders are characterized by pervasive and enduring dysfunctional interpersonal functioning, including parenting, and could thus entail risk for offspring in not developing adaptive interpersonal skills. However, no study has tested this possibility. A representative sample drawn from two birth cohorts of Norwegian 4-year-olds (n = 956) and their parents was followed up at ages 6, 8, and 10 years. Parents' personality disorder symptoms were measured dimensionally with the DSM-IV and ICD-10 Personality Questionnaire, and children's social skills were evaluated by the Social Skills Rating System. A difference-in-difference approach was applied to adjust for all unmeasured time-invariant confounders, and parental symptoms of depression and anxiety were entered as covariates. Increased Cluster B symptoms in parents of children aged 4 to 6 years predicted decreased social skill development in offspring (B = -0.97, 95% CI -1.58, -0.37, p = 0.002). On a more granular level, increased symptoms of borderline (B = -0.39, CI -0.65, -0.12, p = 0.004), histrionic (B = -0.55, CI -0.99, -0.11, p = 0.018), and avoidant (B = -0.46, CI-0.79, -0.13, p = 0.006) personality disorders in parents predicted decreased social skill development in offspring.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are commonly reported co-occurring mental health consequences of psychological trauma exposure. The disorders have high genetic overlap. Trauma is a complex phenotype but research suggests that trauma sensitivity has a heritable basis. We investigated whether sensitivity to trauma in those with MDD reflects a similar genetic component in those with PTSD.
Methods. Genetic correlations between PTSD and MDD in individuals reporting trauma and MDD in individuals not reporting trauma were estimated, as well as with recurrent MDD and single-episode MDD, using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. Genetic correlations were replicated using PTSD data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and the Million Veteran Program. Polygenic risk scores were generated in UK Biobank participants who met the criteria for lifetime MDD (N= 29 471). We investigated whether genetic loading for PTSD was associated with reporting trauma in these individuals.
Results. Genetic loading for PTSD was significantly associated with reporting trauma in individuals with MDD [OR 1.04 (95% CI 1.01-1.07), Empirical-p = 0.02]. PTSD was significantly more genetically correlated with recurrent MDD than with MDD in individuals not reporting trauma (r(g) differences = similar to 0.2, p < 0.008). Participants who had experienced recurrent MDD reported significantly higher rates of trauma than participants who had experienced singleepisode MDD (chi(2) > 166, p < 0.001)
Conclusions. Our findings point towards the existence of genetic variants associated with trauma sensitivity that might be shared between PTSD and MDD, although replication with better powered GWAS is needed.

When measures of parenting precede changes in child development, researchers typically infer a causal role of parenting practices and attitudes on child development. However, this research is usually conducted with parents raising their own biological offspring. Such research designs cannot account for the effects of genes that are common to parents and children, nor for genetically influenced traits in children that influence how they are parented and how parenting affects them. The aim of this monograph is to provide a clearer view of parenting by synthesizing findings from the Early Growth and Development Study (EGDS).EGDS is a longitudinal study of adopted children, their birth parents, and their rearing parents studied across infancy and childhood. Families (N = 561) were recruited in the United States through adoption agencies between 2000 and 2010. Data collection began when adoptees were 9 months old (males = 57.2%; White 54.5%, Black 13.2%, Hispanic/Latinx 13.4%, Multiracial 17.8%, other 1.1%). The median child age at adoption placement was 2 days (M = 5.58, SD = 11.32). Adoptive parents were predominantly in their 30s, White, and coming from upper-middle- or upper-class backgrounds with high educational attainment (a mode at 4-year college or graduate degree). Most adoptive parents were heterosexual couples, and were married at the beginning of the project. The birth parent sample was more racially and ethnically diverse, but the majority (70%) were White. At the beginning of the study, most birth mothers and fathers were in their 20s, with a mode of educational attainment at high school degree, and few of them were married. We have been following these family members over time, assessing their genetic influences, prenatal environment, rearing environment, and child development.Controlling for effects of genes common to parents and children, we confirmed some previously reported associations between parenting, parent psychopathology, and marital adjustment in relation to child problematic and prosocial behavior. We also observed effects of children's heritable characteristics, characteristics thought to be transmitted from parent to child by genetic means, on their parents and how those effects contributed to subsequent child development. For example, we found that genetically influenced child impulsivity and social withdrawal both elicited harsh parenting, whereas a genetically influenced sunny disposition elicited parental warmth. We found numerous instances of children's genetically influenced characteristics that enhanced positive parental influences on child development or that protected them from harsh parenting. Integrating our findings, we propose a new, genetically informed process model of parenting. We posit that parents implicitly or explicitly detect genetically influenced liabilities and assets in their children. We also suggest future research into factors such as marital adjustment, that favor parents responding with appropriate protection or enhancement. Our findings illustrate a productive use of genetic information in prevention research: helping parents respond effectively to a profile of child strengths and challenges rather than using genetic information simply to identify some children unresponsive to current preventive interventions.",MAR 2022,87,2022,2022-03-01,MAR,Journal,N,0037-976X,1540-5834,10.1111/mono.12460,NA,MEDLINE:37070594,NA,NA,NA,MONOGRAPHS OF THE SOCIETY FOR RESEARCH IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT,Parenting in the Context of the Child: Genetic and Social Processes,MONOGR SOC RES CHILD,Monogr.

We aimed to compare the prophylactic effects of different antidepressant medicines (ADMs). Methods PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase and the Web of Science were searched on 4 July 2019. A pooled analysis of parametric survival curves was performed using a Bayesian framework. The main outcomes were hazard ratios (HRs), relapse-free survival and mean relapse-free months. Results Forty randomized controlled trials were included. The 1-year relapse-free survival for ADM (76%) was significantly better than that for placebo (56%). Most of the relapse difference (86.5%) occurred in the first 6 months. Most HRs were not constant over time. Proof of benefit after 6 months of follow-up was not established partially because of small differences between the drug and placebo after 6 months. Almost all studies used an 'enriched' randomized discontinuation design, which may explain the high relapse rates in the first 6 months after randomization. Conclusions The superiority of ADM v. placebo was mainly attributed to the difference in relapse rates that occurred in the first 6 months.

Method: This sample (N = 550) of professionals and caregivers from a foster care system in the United States completed an online survey regarding their experiences of COVID-19 related stress in multiple domains (disruptions in routines, income/employment, food access, medical/mental health care access, access to social support, worries about COVID, family conflict/violence, and COVID diagnoses). The survey also included established measures of STS and BO. Results: A subset of COVID-19 stressors was found to account for 27.4% of the variance in STS and 24.7% of the variance in BO scores in regression analyses. Significant correlates for STS included worries about COVID, family conflict/violence and food access, while only worries about COVID and family conflict/violence were significant in the model testing BO. Part of the sample (N = 64) had participated in a related 2019 study of STS and BO and were included in comparison analyses of these conditions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results for T1 and T2 comparisons yielded significant increases in STS related symptoms of intrusion and alterations in cognitions and mood, with differences in total STS scores trending toward significance. No significant differences were found in BO scores. Conclusions: These findings and associated implications are discussed for groups of caregivers and helping professionals with preexisting high levels of indirect trauma exposure in a pandemic context.

The present research fills this gap by presenting a theory of gratitude to nature. Findings from four correlational studies and two experiments show some support for its propositions. Gratitude to nature can be conceptualized as a form of benefit-triggered gratitude. The distinction between trait and state gratitude to nature was found to be valid, and both forms of gratitude can be reliably measured. Trait gratitude to nature was associated with some constructs relevant to the human-nature relationship (e.g., experience with nature, connectedness to nature, anthropomorphism of nature) and interpersonal gratitude. Also, trait gratitude to nature was associated with not only intention to perform pro-environmental behavior but also actual donation to environmental causes. Experimental manipulation of gratitude to nature had some behavioral effect, but this effect was not robust. The theory offers novel insights into the understanding of humans' relations with nature and responses to environmental problems.

There has been increasing interest in using neuroimaging measures to predict psychiatric disorders. However, predictions usually rely on large brain networks and large disorder heterogeneity. Thus, they lack both anatomical and behavioural specificity, preventing the advancement of targeted interventions. Here we address both challenges. First, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we parcellated the amygdala, a region implicated in mood disorders, into seven nuclei. Next, a questionnaire factor analysis provided subclinical mental health dimensions frequently altered in anxious-depressive individuals, such as negative emotions and sleep problems. Finally, for each behavioural dimension, we identified the most predictive resting-state functional connectivity between individual amygdala nuclei and highly specific regions of interest, such as the dorsal raphe nucleus in the brainstem or medial frontal cortical regions.

The cohort (n = 321 depressed; n = 218 nondepressed) was followed up after 2+ decades through linkage to nationwide population-based registries. Outcomes included consecutive annual data on unemployment, work disability, social welfare recipiency, and a composite marginalization measure, spanning from age 21 to 40. Longitudinal associations were examined using logistic regression analysis in a generalized estimating equations modeling framework. Subsequent depressive episodes and educational attainment in early adulthood were explored as potential pathways. The results showed that adolescent depression was associated with adult marginalization outcomes, but the strength of association varied across depressed subgroups. Adolescents with persistent depressive disorder had higher odds of all outcomes, including the composite marginalization measure (adjusted OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.4-2.7, p < 0.001), and this was partially (31%) mediated by subsequent depressive episodes in early adulthood. Exploratory moderation analysis revealed that entry into tertiary education mitigated the association with later marginalization, but only for adolescents with episodic major depression. In conclusion, the risk for future labor market marginalization is elevated among depressed adolescents, particularly those presenting with persistent depressive disorder.

In this paper, we test the ability of different feature extraction methods (i.e., improved dense trajectories, OpenFace) and ML techniques (i.e., support vector machines vs. deep neural networks) to distinguish liars from truth-tellers based on facial micro-expressions, using a new video data set collected in low-stakes situations. During the interviews, a technique to increase liars' cognitive load was applied, facilitating cues of lies to emerge.
Results highlighted that support vector machines (SVMs) coupled with OpenFace resulted in the best performing method (AUC = 0.72 videos without cognitive load; AUC = 0.78 videos with cognitive load). All the tested classifiers performed better when a cognitive load was imposed on the interviewee, confirming that the technique of increasing cognitive load during an interview facilitates deception recognition.

Additionally, the present study provided information for helping professionals to choose the best PHQ version according to the context. Methods The sample was composed of 2579 participants from 22 Spanish PHC centers participating in the EIRA-3 study.

The results obtained confirm the theoretically expected relationship between PHQ results and anxiety, social support and health-related QoL. A single-factor solution was confirmed. Regarding to the level of agreement with the CIDI interview (used as the criterion), our results indicate that the PHQ has a good discrimination power.

Given the strong and bidirectional relationship between trauma and substance misuse, policy responses to this crisis that reflect principles of trauma-informed care are especially salient. This study is the first to use trauma-informed policy analysis to systematically assess the U.S. Congressional response to the opioid epidemic. Method: We used policy mapping methods to build and analyze a dataset of all opioid-related bills and resolutions proposed in Congress between 2009 and 2017 (N = 188). Following an established trauma-informed policy analysis framework, 2 researchers reviewed these policies and coded their incorporation of trauma-specific language and the principles of safety; choice; trust and transparency; collaboration and peer support; empowerment; and intersectionality. We calculated coding frequencies in these categories and rates of intercoder agreement. Results: A minority of policies (10.6%) directly mentioned trauma and 55% of policies incorporated at least 1 trauma-informed principle. Safety was the most commonly coded principle (38.3%), while intersectionality was the least (6.9%). Conclusions: Our analysis found limited attention to trauma in opioid-related federal legislation. Based on these findings and following the example of coalitions such as the Campaign for Trauma-Informed Policy and Practice, advocates can mobilize for better inclusion of trauma-informed principles in opioid policy. Further, this study demonstrates the feasibility of applying the trauma-informed policy analysis framework to code Congressional policies using publicly available data, a replicable methodology with potential application at federal and state levels.
Clinical Impact Statement Given that psychological trauma is often linked with substance misuse, this study investigated the extent to which U.S. federal legislation responding to the recent opioid crisis was trauma-informed. Approximately 11% of opioid-related bills or resolutions introduced in Congress between 2009 and 2017 mentioned the term ""trauma"" and 55% were aligned with at least one principle of trauma-informed care, such as safety, choice, or empowerment.

Specifically, for those who have achieved ""expertness"" in the practice of group work, this grounded theory (GT) study explores both how have they done so and how such practitioners, in turn, train and evaluate effectiveness in their group therapy trainees. Through analysis of in-depth interviews with nine peer-nominated expert group therapists, essential components of their development included an emphasis on experiential training, personal therapy, didactic coursework, participating in professional conferences, and simply enjoying group work. The study also identifies common competencies that these experts look for to determine effectiveness among their trainees, as well as how these experts determine their own level of effectiveness (and how these processes differ). Finally, the study proposes an emergent theoretical model as to how one develops a professional identity as a group therapist.

The analysis shows that the achievement of different learning outcomes ought to be investigated separately. The attainment of knowledge strongly benefited from individualized learning, as well as from the discussion and practical application of ethical standards. Contrarily, not covering ethical standards tended to be a feature of successful courses, when looking at other learning outcomes. Overall, experiential learning approaches where learners were emotionally involved in thinking about how to deal with problems were most effective.

However, autistic people have poorer participation rates and outcomes in university than those with all other disabilities or without disabilities. Most research conducted with autistic young adults in the university environment focuses on their social and communicative challenges and supports rather than on how the physical environment impacts an autistic student's university experience. Therefore, there is a need for research into how the sensory aspects of the university environment can affect the well-being and outcomes of autistic students.Methods: This qualitative study explored the experiences of seven autistic university students in the physical spaces of an Australian university. Using a semi-structured interview guide, and photo-elicitation, we collected data in one-on-one interviews with seven autistic undergraduate students.Results: We found that sensory aspects of physical spaces on university campuses are both enabling and challenging for autistic students. These aspects not only impact how students navigate and utilize aspects of the campus, but they also influence how students engage and participate at university. Autistic students need the space and resources to manage sensory overload on campus, and universities that seek to support autistic students need to consider the physical and sensory needs of this cohort.Conclusions: Inclusive university education requires attention to the physical aspects of campuses that support the mental and physical well-being of autistic students.
Community brief Why was this study done?Autistic people are less likely to enroll in and complete further education than those with all other disabilities or without disabilities. Most research conducted with autistic young adults in the university environment focuses on their social and communication challenges, rather than the enabling and disabling aspects of the physical university environment. What was the purpose of this study?This study aimed to capture and understand autistic students' experiences in navigating and participating in the physical spaces in an Australian university. What did the researchers do?We interviewed seven undergraduate university students about the places and spaces on the university campus that they found challenging and enabling. Participants took photographs of these spaces before the interview and brought the photographs with them for discussion. What were the results of the study?We found that the participants readily identified places on the campus that were both enabling and challenging. Physical aspects that were challenging included noisy spaces, crowded areas, and spaces with bright artificial lights. These spaces impacted on their ability to participate and succeed in their studies. They also impacted on their ability to interact with other students, their enjoyment of university, and their physical and emotional well-being. Comfortable spaces that allowed them to recharge were those that were quiet, less busy, had lower levels of sensory input, and allowed them to unmask. What do these findings add to what was already known?Previous research on the university experience of autistic students has focused primarily on social and educational supports. Research on sensory-friendly education settings has typically focused on primary and secondary education. This study provides evidence of the importance of physical and sensory environments in the educational experience of autistic students in a postsecondary environment. What are potential weaknesses in the study?The main weakness of the study is the small number of participants (n = 7) and that they were all drawn from one university. While this limits the generalizability of the findings, this was an exploratory study and an important first step in developing our understanding of barriers and facilitators to inclusion on a university campus. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future?While this is a small-scale exploratory study, and there is a need for more research in this area, there are some simple takeaways that could be implemented by universities at minimal cost to support the inclusion of autistic students. For example, sensory input could be reduced by lowering the volume of piped music or reducing the number or brightness of lights. Simple supports for students experiencing sensory overload could include quiet times in cafeterias and access to sensory retreat rooms. At a minimum, our findings could serve as a starting point for discussions between university administrators and autistic students about necessary environmental adjustments to create more inclusive campuses.",NA,NA,2022,2022-12-07,DEC 7,Journal,N,2573-9581,2573-959X,10.1089/aut.2022.0053,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,AUTISM IN ADULTHOOD,Exploring Environmental Barriers and Facilitators to Inclusion on a University Campus for Autistic Students,AUTISM ADULTHOOD,Autism Adulthood,AUTISM ADUL,AUTISM ADULTHOOD,1,publisher,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",1,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",AUTISM IN ADULTHOOD

Depressive symptoms, such as depressed mood, are common in older adults and associated with an increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Given the evidence that sleep disturbance and alterations in interferon (IFN)-gamma biology are associated with depression risk, this study examines the separate and joint contributions of poor sleep maintenance and IFN-gamma to depressed mood in older adults.
Methods. Community-dwelling, non-depressed older adults (n = 36, 72.1 +/- 6.8 years) underwent a night of polysomnography to assess sleep maintenance [i.e. wake time after sleep onset (WASO)]. The morning after polysomnography, plasma levels of IFN-gamma were evaluated along with self-reported depressed mood throughout the day. Multivariate linear regression tested associations of WASO and IFN-gamma with the severity of depressed mood. In addition, moderation and mediation models examined the role of IFN-gamma for the relationship between WASO and depressed mood.
Results. A greater amount of WASO (p < 0.05) and higher levels of IFN-gamma (p < 0.01) were both associated with the severity of depressed mood. Moreover, IFN-gamma moderated the relationship between WASO and depressed mood (p < 0.01), such that WASO was more strongly related to the depressed mood among those with higher IFN-y, than among those with lower IFN-gamma. However, IFN-gamma did not mediate the relationship between WASO and depressed mood.
Conclusion. In this study of older adults, poor sleep maintenance and higher levels of IFN-gamma were both related to depressed mood. Moreover, IFN-gamma moderated the relationship between poor sleep maintenance and depressed mood. Together, these findings suggest that older adults with higher IFN-gamma are at heightened risk for depressive symptoms following sleep disturbance.",JUN 2023,53,2023,2022-02-11,JUN,Journal,N,0033-2917,1469-8978,10.1017/S0033291722000113,NA,MEDLINE:35144705,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,Interferon-gamma moderation of poor sleep maintenance and depressed mood in community-dwelling older adults,PSYCHOL MED,Psychol.

The primary outcome was a diagnosis of ADHD on the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Present Lifetime version. 230 (22.4%) of the 1026 students screened positive at Stage 1 (parent and teacher questionnaires) (Sensitivity 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.96], specificity 0.80 [95% CI, 0.78-0.83], false positive rate 0.20 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.23), false negative rate was 0.14 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.16). 65 remained screen-positive at the Stage 2 screen (teacher to teacher SNAP-IV interview). 36/65 (55.4%) of these Stage 2 screen positive participants and 1/144 (0.7%) of the screen negative subjects met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD (sensitivity 0.83 [95% CI, 0.71-0.95]; specificity of 0.97 [95% CI, 0.96-0.98]; false positive rate 0.03 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.04], false negative rate 0.16 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.19].

Multivariate analyses indicated that only adverse childhood experiences and weaker academic orientation predicted both outcomes.

Method: Stigma related to gender, race, and Latinx ethnicity was measured at the structural level using objective state-level indicators of social policies and prejudicial attitudes and at the individual level using self-reports of perceived discrimination. Respective associations of stigma with hippocampal volume and amygdala reactivity to threat were examined using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N = 11,534, mean age 9.9 years), the first multisite neuroimaging study that provided substantial variability in sociopolitical contexts and that included individual-level measures of stigma among youth.
Results: In a preregistered analysis, Black (B =-58.26, p = .023) and Latinx (B =-40.10, p = .044) youths in higher (vs lower) structural stigma contexts were found to have smaller hippocampal volume, controlling for total intracranial volume, demographics, and family socioeconomic status. This association was also observed at a trend-level among girls (p= .082). The magnitude of the difference in hippocampal volume between high and low structural stigma states was equivalent to the predicted impact of a $20,000 difference in annual family income in this sample. As hypothesized, structural stigma was not associated with hippocampal volume in nonstigmatized youths, providing evidence of specificity. Perceived discrimination was unrelated to hippocampal volume in stigmatized groups. No associations between perceived discrimination or structural stigma and amygdala reactivity to threat were observed.
Conclusion: This study provides novel evidence that an objective measure of structural stigma may be more strongly related to hippocampal volume than subjective perceptions of stigma, suggesting that contextual approaches to stigma could yield new insights into neurodevelopment among marginalized youth.",JUN 2022,61,2022,2022-05-25,JUN,Journal,N,0890-8567,1527-5418,10.1016/j.jaac.2021.08.017,NA,MEDLINE:34481917,NA,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY,Smaller Hippocampal Volume Among Black and Latinx Youth Living in High-Stigma Contexts,J AM ACAD CHILD PSY,J.

Studying these characteristics together and prospectively within a population confronted with high stressor exposure (e.g. U.S. Army soldiers) has not been done, yet could uncover unique and interactive predictive effects that may inform prevention and early intervention efforts. Methods Five broad personality traits and social network size were assessed via self-administered questionnaires among experienced soldiers preparing for deployment (N = 4645) and new soldiers reporting for basic training (N = 6216). Predictive models examined associations of baseline personality and social network variables with recent distress disorders or suicidal behaviors assessed 3- and 9-months post-deployment and approximately 5 years following enlistment. Results Among the personality traits, elevated neuroticism was consistently associated with increased mental health risk following deployment. Small social networks were also associated with increased mental health risk following deployment, beyond the variance accounted for by personality. Limited support was found for social network size moderating the association between personality and mental health outcomes. Small social networks also predicted distress disorders and suicidal behavior 5 years following enlistment, whereas unique effects of personality traits on these more distal outcomes were rare. Conclusions Heightened neuroticism and small social networks predict a greater risk for negative mental health sequelae, especially following deployment.

Based on results, this article also provides recommendations on specific ways in which PTSD treatments may need to adapt to help clients make sense of a stress response to the ongoing threat of the pandemic, which is distinct from a posttraumatic response to a past threat.
Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has been conceptualized as a potentially traumatic event, although heterogeneity in experience (e.g., isolation) and in type and severity of traumatic stress response (e.g., hygiene hypervigilance) query the applicability of the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic construct. Parallels may be drawn to chronic illness and continuous traumatic situations (CTS) literature, which suggests unique symptom presentations that may occur during cumulative, ongoing traumas. Method: Eighty-four adults completed the PTSD Checklist with appended questions evaluating pandemic index events, temporality of intrusive symptoms, self-appraised abnormality, and context dependence of symptoms. Using exploratory latent profile analysis, we modeled the latent structure of traumatic stress response to COVID-19 in order to evaluate possible nuanced patterns of symptoms differentiating PTSD from a transient ongoing trauma response. Results: Two profiles broadly delineated by severity across all variables emerged, suggesting the framework of PTSD is apt when applied to COVID-19.

Method: Latent class analysis was used to identify naturally occurring subgroups of PTSD symptoms in a sample of sexual assault survivors who completed two mailed surveys 1 year apart (N = 1,271). Latent transition analysis was then used to examine individuals' probabilities of transitioning into each latent class at Time 2 based on their latent class membership at Time 1. Results: A four-class model emerged as the best fitting model at both Time 1 and Time 2. Classes demonstrated overall severity and symptom cluster severity differences. Transition into a lower severity class was more common than transition into a higher severity class, though escalation was demonstrated by 6-20% of participants in each latent class. Conclusions: The substantial heterogeneity in sexual assault survivors' PTSD symptoms highlights the variety of ways that posttraumatic stress may be experienced years after a sexual assault. Future research should explore factors that affect long-term symptoms, including cumulative lifetime trauma and social support.
Clinical Impact Statement The substantial variation in sexual assault survivors' posttraumatic stress symptoms, as well as the frequency with which transition occurred between latent classes, indicates that change in symptoms continues to occur years, even decades, after a sexual assault. The varied prominence of symptom clusters across latent classes encourages attention to how specific symptoms may impact individuals' experiences of posttraumatic stress over time. Consistent elevation of reactivity symptoms suggests that these symptoms may warrant particular clinical attention for gender-based violence survivors.",NA,NA,2022,2022-09-29,SEP 29,Journal,N,1942-9681,1942-969X,10.1037/tra0001376,NA,MEDLINE:36174154,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY,Longitudinal Patterns of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Among Sexual Assault Survivors: A Latent Transition Analysis,PSYCHOL TRAUMA-US,Psychol.

Our fundamental assumption is that a positive bargaining zone does not imply symmetric preferences for an agreement. One or both negotiators may prefer an impasse over an agreement despite a positive bargaining zone. We argue that it is beneficial for management research to distinguish between three impasse types: If both negotiators perceive benefit from an impasse, they are wanted; if one negotiator perceives benefits from an impasse, they are forced; and if both do not perceive benefits from the impasse, they are unwanted. We review structural (e.g., bargaining zone, communication channels), interpersonal (e.g., tough tactics, emotions), and intrapersonal (e.g., biases, available information, and framing) factors as the likely antecedents of the three impasse types.

Ageing populations have the propensity to rate their health status more inaccurately than their younger counterparts. As a result, we (1) devised a metric which categorized older adults into groups based on the discrepancy between their self-rated health (SRH) and Frailty Index (FI) scores, and (2) investigated which factors predict group membership.
Design. A cross-sectional design was employed using data from The Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing (TILDA).
Methods. A health asymmetry metric was derived: this categorized 6907 participants (aged 50+ years) into three groups: 'health pessimistic' where participants underestimated their healthiness, 'health realistic' where participants accurately assessed their health, and 'health optimistic' where participants overestimated their healthiness. A multinomial logistic regression modelled the ability of a set of sociodemographic, psychosocial, and health behaviour variables in predicting membership of these categories.
Results. A significant proportion of the study population were categorized as 'health realistic' (similar to 69%). The prevalence rates of health optimistic individuals increased in older age groups, and conversely, health pessimistic rates decreased in older age groups. Most notably, psychosocial factors significantly predicted being health pessimistic: such as anxiety (OR = 1.03), loneliness (OR = 1.04), and decreased social connectedness (OR = 0.87). However, less clear sociodemographic, psychosocial, and health behaviour associations were found for being health optimistic.
Conclusion. Health asymmetry is a useful method of identifying at-risk individuals for inaccurate SRH. The ability of this metric to predict clinical mental health outcomes should be investigated.",SEP 2022,27,2022,2022-02-11,SEP,Journal,N,1359-107X,2044-8287,10.1111/bjhp.12585,NA,MEDLINE:35148035,NA,NA,NA,BRITISH JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY,Expecting the best or fearing the worst: Discrepancies between self-rated health and frailty in an ageing Irish population,BRIT J HEALTH PSYCH,Br.

Impulsivity was shown to be strongly related to VB, and different evolutions of impulsivity were noticed along treatments. One possible variable involved in the relationship between VB and the evolution of impulsivity is cannabis use (CU). The high prevalence of CU in EPP and its relationship with VB led us to investigate: 1/the impact of CU and 2/the impact of early CU on the evolution of impulsivity levels during a 3-year program, in violent and non-violent EPP patients. Methods 178 non-violent and 62 violent patients (VPs) were followed-up over a 3 year period. Age of onset of CU was assessed at program entry and impulsivity was assessed seven times during the program. The evolution of impulsivity level during the program, as a function of the violent and non-violent groups of patients and CU precocity were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. Results Over the treatment period, impulsivity level did not evolve as a function of the interaction between group and CU (coef. = 0.02, p = 0.425). However, when including precocity of CU, impulsivity was shown to increase significantly only in VPs who start consuming before 15 years of age (coef. = 0.06, p = 0.008).

They also had their blood drawn midway through both the first and second semester to measure C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. An inflammatory composite for each semester was created by averaging the standardized scores for log-transformed C-reactive protein and interleukin-6.Results: Compared to continuing-gens, first-gens had greater systemic inflammation in the first semester regardless of their level of emotional support (B = 0.515, p = .003). However, emotional support moderated the association between college generation status and prospective systemic inflammation in the second semester (B =-0.525, p = .007) such that first-gens had greater systemic inflammation compared to continuing-gens, but only if they reported lower levels of emotional support (B = 0.826, p = .002).

For Black but not White targets, however, perceptions of dominance from expansive poses were mediated by greater attributions of aggression. Three additional experiments examined the influence of poses on evaluations in professional and interpersonal contexts. Experiment 2 indicated that expansive compared to constrictive poses led to greater expectations of professional success for White than Black targets. Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated that expansive compared to constrictive poses led to a greater willingness to interact in an interpersonal setting with White but not Black targets. Attributions of aggression related to expansive poses by Black targets reduced the likelihood that they were chosen as interaction partners.

Studying how fear conditioning and extinction constructs relate to anxiety symptoms and reactivity to stressful and benign moments in everyday life provides a powerful addition to experimental paradigms. Method Fifty-one young adults completed laboratory-based differential conditioning and extinction tasks with (CS + ) and without (CS-) an aversive unconditional stimulus (US). Electrodermal skin conductance responses were measured during each phase, followed by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) tapping anxiety and stressors six times daily for seven days (2, 142 moments). Results Conditioned electrodermal reactivity to the CS + and overgeneralisation to the CS- were associated with greater change in anxiety (measured via EMA), across non-stressful situations, remaining the same across stressful situations. Likewise, during extinction when the CS + is now safe, more electrodermal reactivity to the CS + was associated with more anxiety change across non-stressful situations and remained the same across stressful situations. Also, during extinction when threat is absent, more electrodermal reactivity at the late stage of the CS- was associated with less momentary anxiety change in response to stressful situations; more electrodermal activity at the late stage of the CS + was associated with more anxiety change across non-stressful situations and remained the same across stressful situations. Conclusions Sampling 'in vivo' emotion and stress experiences, study findings revealed links between conditioned electrodermal reactivity and overgeneralisation to safe stimuli and heightened anxious reactivity during non-stressful (i.e. safe) moments in daily life, coupled with less change in response to actual stressors.",AUG 2023,53,2023,2022-09-12,AUG,Journal,N,0033-2917,1469-8978,10.1017/S0033291722002379,NA,MEDLINE:36093766,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,Fear learning and extinction predicts anxiety in daily life: a study of Pavlovian conditioning and ecological momentary assessment,PSYCHOL MED,Psychol.

Little is known about whether these differences are mood state-independent or influenced by acute symptom severity. Therefore, the aim of this study was (1) to replicate abnormalities in white matter microstructure in BD v. MDD and (2) to investigate whether these vary across depressed, euthymic, and manic mood. Methods In this cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging study, n = 136 patients with BD were compared to age- and sex-matched MDD patients and healthy controls (HC) (n = 136 each). Differences in FA were investigated using tract-based spatial statistics. Using interaction models, the influence of acute symptom severity and mood state on the differences between patient groups were tested. Results Analyses revealed a main effect of diagnosis on FA across all three groups (p(tfce-FWE) = 0.003). BD patients showed reduced FA compared to both MDD (p(tfce-FWE) = 0.005) and HC (p(tfce-FWE) < 0.001) in large bilateral clusters. These consisted of several white matter tracts previously described in the literature, including commissural, association, and projection tracts. There were no significant interaction effects between diagnosis and symptom severity or mood state (all p(tfce-FWE) > 0.704). Conclusions Results indicated that the difference between BD and MDD was independent of depressive and manic symptom severity and mood state. Disruptions in white matter microstructure in BD might be a trait effect of the disorder. The potential of FA values to be used as a biomarker to differentiate BD from MDD should be further addressed in future studies using longitudinal designs.",JUL 2023,53,2023,2022-07-14,JUL,Journal,N,0033-2917,1469-8978,10.1017/S0033291722001490,NA,MEDLINE:35833369,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,Reduced fractional anisotropy in bipolar disorder v. major depressive disorder independent of current symptoms,PSYCHOL MED,Psychol.

Resilience is known as a protective factor, but sparse research is conducted on adolescents or assess resilience with consideration of ecological theories. Adolescent Resilience Questionnaire (ARQ) was developed to assess the five dimensions: Individual, Family, Peers, School, and Community and covers the broader ecological resilience spectrum. Objective: As resilience is a part of the human being survival system we wanted to investigate if resilience measured with ARQ, could moderate associations between experiences of trauma and trauma symptoms. Method: Six hundred fifty adolescents between 15 and 17 years old were asked to complete the Linkoping Youth Life Experience Scale (LYLES), the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC), and the Adolescent Resilience Questionnaire (ARQ). Result: The results showed that high scores on any dimension of the ARQ were negatively associated with trauma symptoms and that the dimension Peers moderated the effect of trauma symptoms on both interpersonal traumatic events and adverse childhood circumstances for males. The dimension Family moderated the effect of trauma symptoms on noninterpersonal traumatic events for females. Conclusion: Resilience seems to be an important factor when it comes to evaluating posttraumatic symptoms and that different resilience factors have different meanings for different types of traumas as well for boys and girls.
Clinical Impact Statement Growing up is a challenge for many children, not least because more than 80% of students at the age of seventeen have experienced at least one victimizing/traumatizing event. This study is based on an ecological model (Adolescent Resilience Questionnaire, ARQ) that measures different resilience factors and examines their different capabilities to moderate the effect of trauma (Linkoping Youth Life Experience Scale, LYLES) on trauma symptoms (Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, TSCC).

Contractor and colleagues thus proposed a Positive Memory-PTSD model outlining hypothesized pathways (e.g., improved cognitions and affect) linking active processing of positive memories and PTSD symptoms. In the current study, we empirically explored direct and indirect pathways of the Positive Memory-PTSD model including relations between presence/types of processing memory methodology, posttrauma maladaptive cognitions, positive/negative affect, and PTSD symptom severity. Methods: We randomly assigned 65 students reporting trauma histories to time-matched narrating (identifying and sharing details of elicited positive memories), writing (identifying and writing details of elicited positive memories), or control conditions. Participants completed self-report measures (T0) and repeated their assigned task condition and self-report measures 6-8 days later (T1). Results: Half-longitudinal models demonstrated direct associations of (1) being in the narrating versus other conditions with decreases in posttrauma maladaptive cognitions and negative affect, and increases in positive affect; and (2) increases in posttrauma maladaptive cognitions and negative affect with greater PTSD symptom severity. Although, when controlling for posttrauma maladaptive cognitions and negative/positive affect, being in the narrating versus other conditions was associated with decreases in PTSD symptom severity, these constructs did not explain examined relations. Conclusions: Results suggest beneficial impacts of narrating positive memories on PTSD symptom severity (accounting for cognitions/affect) and improved cognitions/affect, and a need to examine moderating variables (e.g., emotion regulation) in the Positive Memory-PTSD model.

This rapidly growing empirical literature has raised a critical question: How can we best make use of these empirical findings to achieve our aim of explaining, predicting, and controlling mental disorders? In this article, we argue that achieving these aims requires the construction of formal theories and we investigate how empirical research can best inform the construction of well-developed formal theories. We begin by reviewing the philosophy of science literature to clarify the nature of formal theories, data models, and the relationship between them. We identify three plausible ways in which empirical data models can be used to develop formal theories. In the first, data models are treated as formal theories. In the second, data models are used to make direct inferences about the real world and, thereby, inform the development of a formal theory. In the third, the empirical data model is compared to a theory-implied data model, and any differences between them is used to inform subsequent theory development. Using simulations from a computational model of panic disorder, we investigate which of these three routes best informs the development of formal theories of psychopathology and conclude that the third approach is most promising. We then build on this evaluation by proposing the abductive formal theory construction (AFTC) framework: a three-stage framework rooted in abductive inference and the comparison between theory-implied and empirical data models. We argue that this approach provides a challenging, yet promising way forward for using empirical research to construct formal theories.
Over the past decade, there has been a surge of empirical research investigating mental disorders as complex systems. In this article, we investigate how to best make use of this growing body of empirical research and move the field toward its fundamental aims of explaining, predicting, and controlling psychopathology. We first review the contemporary philosophy of science literature on scientific theories and argue that fully achieving the aims of explanation, prediction, and control requires that we construct formal theories of mental disorders: theories expressed in the language of mathematics or a computational programming language. We then investigate three routes by which one can use empirical findings (i.e., data models) to construct formal theories: (a) using data models themselves as formal theories, (b) using data models to infer formal theories, and (c) comparing empirical data models to theory-implied data models in order to evaluate and refine an existing formal theory. We argue that the third approach is the most promising path forward. We conclude by introducing the abductive formal theory construction (AFTC) framework, informed by both our review of philosophy of science and our methodological investigation. We argue that this approach provides a clear and promising way forward for using empirical research to inform the generation, development, and testing of formal theories both in the domain of psychopathology and in the broader field of psychological science.",DEC 2022,27,2022,2021-11-04,DEC,Journal,N,1082-989X,1939-1463,10.1037/met0000303,NA,MEDLINE:34735175,NA,NA,NA,PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS,Modeling Psychopathology: From Data Models to Formal Theories,PSYCHOL METHODS,Psychol.

In this study, we broaden the existing knowledge by examining when and how the pattern of team boundary spanning, particularly the differentiation in team member boundary-spanning activities, promotes team creativity. Based on the categorization-elaboration model, we propose a curvilinear relationship between team member boundary-spanning differentiation and creativity that is mediated through information sharing. Further, we add an important layer of understanding to the nature of this curvilinear relationship by identifying team goal interdependence as an important moderator.

In four mixed-methods studies, we study how gheirat is experienced, what situations elicit it, and its social functions among Iranian adults (N = 1,107) using qualitative interviews, scenario- and prototype-based surveys, and an experiment. The prototypical experience of gheirat consisted of diverse appraisals (including sense of responsibility, insecurity, and low self-worth) and emotional components (including hostility, social fears, and low empowerment). We identified three types of relational violations that elicit gheirat: harm or insult to namoos (people and self-relevant entities one is obliged to protect), romantic betrayal by namoos, and intrusions by a third person. Each violation type led to a distinct variant of the prototype. Contrary to folk theories of gheirat, we did not find support for the idea that gheirat is a predominantly male experience. However, an experiment on the signaling effects of gheirat revealed that gheirat expressors are ascribed both positive and negative traits, but positive traits prevail for men and negative traits prevail for women.

The present study aimed to distinguish subgroups with distinct profiles of functioning across motor, cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial domains. These profiles were related to neonatal and social/environmental factors.
Method: The sample included 1977 children born very preterm (<32 weeks' gestation) in 2011 from the French population-based EPIPAGE-2 cohort. Using latent profile analysis, subgroups of children were distinguished based on their functioning at 5.5 years. The relation between outcome profiles and neonatal and social/environmental factors was tested using multivariable multinomial logistic regression analysis.
Results: Four subgroups with distinct outcome profiles were distinguished: no deficit in any domain (45%); motor and cognitive deficits without behavioral/psychosocial deficits (31%); primarily behavioral and psychosocial deficits (16%); and deficits in multiple domains (8%). Male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1-2.7), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (OR = 2.1-2.8), low parental education level (OR = 1.8-2.1), and parental non-European immigrant status (OR = 2.3-3.0) were independently associated with higher odds for all suboptimal outcome profiles compared to the favorable outcome profile.
Conclusion: Among 5.5-year-old very preterm born children, subgroups can be distinguished with distinct outcome profiles that vary in severity, type, and combinations of deficits. This information is important for the development of interventions that are tailored to the needs of large subgroups of children across multiple domains of functioning.

This research investigates the moral motives behind the suppression of sensory consumption. Is the suppression of sensory consumption caused by the moral motive to promote social justice or the moral motive to promote social order? We test these two competing accounts through country-level archival data and seven preregistered controlled experiments. We find robust evidence that the social-order emphasizing binding moral foundations (authority, loyalty, and purity; Haidt, 2007) suppress sensory consumption. Consequently, individuals and societies that adhere to the binding values are less likely to consume sensory products such as alcohol, tobacco, soda, fragrances, and sex toys. These effects are mediated by prescriptive moral beliefs and feelings of shame. We also identify several moderators of the moral suppression of sensory consumption. Binding values do not suppress sensory consumption after moral licensing. The effects of binding values on sensory consumption attenuate when the products are framed as status-affirming. Finally, while binding values suppress sensory consumption that is personal, they do not suppress sensory consumption that is shared. Altogether, our findings show that social-order emphasizing moral beliefs in society can inhibit the pursuit of pleasure and change consumption patterns in the economy.",JUL 2023,125,2023,2022-11-10,JUL,Journal,N,0022-3514,1939-1315,10.1037/pspp0000450,NA,MEDLINE:36355686,NA,NA,NA,JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,When Is Sensory Consumption Immoral?,J PERS SOC PSYCHOL,J.

Methods: Using nationally representative data from the 2011-2015 and 2015-2019 National Survey of Family Growth, we use logistic regression to examine changes in the receipt of formal sex education by gender. For 2015-2019, we estimate patterns by gender and race/ethnicity for content, timing, and location of instruction. Results: Between 2011-2015 and 2015-2019, there were few significant changes in adolescents' receipt of formal sex education. Between these periods, instruction on waiting until marriage to have sex declined (73%-67% female [F.], p = .005; 70%-58% males [M.], p < .001). In both the periods, about half of the adolescents received sex education that meets the minimum standard articulated in national goals. In 2015-2019, there were significant gender differences in the instruction about waiting until marriage to have sex (67% F., 58% M., p < 001) and condom skills (55% F., 60% M., p = .003). Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic males were less likely than non Hispanic White males to receive formal instruction before the first sex on sexually transmitted infection/HIV, birth control, or where to get birth control. Many adolescents reported religious settings as the sources of instruction about waiting until marriage to have sex (56% F. and 49% M.), but almost none received instruction about birth control from those settings. Conclusions: Differences in the receipt of sex education, by gender, race/ethnicity, and the location of instruction, leave many adolescents without critical information. Gaps in meeting national objectives indicate the need to expand the provision of sex education. (c) 2021 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Human languages are based on syntax, a set of rules which allow an infinite number of meaningful sentences to be constructed from a finite set of words. A theory associated with Chomsky and others holds that syntax is a mind-internal, universal structure independent of semantics. This theory, however, has been challenged by studies of the Chinese language showing that syntax is processed under the semantic umbrella, and is secondary and not independent. Here, using intracranial high-density electrocorticography, we find distinct spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus that are specifically associated with syntactic and semantic processing of Chinese sentences.

The results showed that fake and true news were processed in a similar way. Emotional response and perceived credibility did not only depend on the content, but also on previous beliefs. Negative beliefs about the political system increased emotional response to true and false news, which in turn increased perceptions of credibility, leading to higher accuracy attributions and willingness of sharing news (true or false). The most distinctive difference between the participants interactions with fake and true news was that participants willingness to share fake news was not entirely explained by emotional response and credibility perceptions.

In a sample of 127 university students, we find robust evidence that individual entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) is negatively related to decision-making under risk and uncertainty. In addition, we show that distinguishing the subscales of IEO is key to understanding this relationship, since while the relationship is negative for the Proactiveness and Innovativeness subscales, it is positive for the Risk taking subscale.

Although many factors can impact intimacy, the increased regular use of technological devices within our daily lives makes technoference an important one to consider. Technoference (i.e., interference in face-to-face interactions caused by the use of technological devices) is commonly associated with relationship difficulties, including conflict, dissatisfaction, and decreased relational well-being. However, less is known about the direct and indirect impact of technoference on intimacy among couples. We hypothesized that negative perceptions of a partner's technology use and poor communication satisfaction within a romantic relationship help explain the association between technoference and intimacy. University students (N = 141), who were in a romantic relationship of at least 6 months duration, completed online questionnaires assessing technoference, perceptions of their partner's technology use, communication satisfaction, and intimacy in their romantic relationship. PROCESS macro model 6 was used to test the serial mediation models. Results suggest that the relationship between technoference (general, partner's, and participant's) and intimacy is serially mediated by negative perceptions of partner's technology use and communication satisfaction. These findings can help to identify and inform strategies to maximize intimacy levels between couples, thus fortifying romantic relationships as a whole.",DEC 1 2022,25,2022,2022-11-18,DEC 1,Journal,N,2152-2715,2152-2723,10.1089/cyber.2022.0068,NA,MEDLINE:36399524,NA,NA,NA,CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING,Romance Behind the Screens: Exploring the Role of Technoference on Intimacy,CYBERPSYCH BEH SOC N,Cyberpsychology Behav.

Waterpipe tobacco smoking involves the inhalation of heated tobacco smoke after passing through water, and it has been associated with an identified dependence effect similar to that found with cigarette smoking. Despite the popularity of waterpipe tobacco among youth (and in particular, university students) in many countries, detailed data of its usage are lacking in Bangladesh. Therefore, the present study was conducted to explore waterpipe tobacco smoking behavior and normative beliefs among university students in Bangladesh and to assess the factors associated with waterpipe tobacco use. A quantitative cross-sectional survey was carried out among 340 Bangladeshi university students (64.4% male; mean age 21.6 years). Among participants, 13.5% reported they had ever smoked tobacco from a waterpipe and 9.4% had it in past 30 days. Among past 30-day users, 72% were categorized as having waterpipe smoking dependence (n = 23). No females in the sample had ever smoked using a waterpipe. Maternal occupation, monthly expenditure, and regular smoking status were major predominant factors associated with waterpipe smoking behavior of the students. The study is of existential value given that there are no prior studies ever carried out in Bangladesh previously. Recommendations are provided based on the study's findings, particularly in relation to what action is needed from universities in Bangladesh.",OCT 2022,20,2022,2020-05-26,OCT,Journal,N,1557-1874,1557-1882,10.1007/s11469-020-00312-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION,Waterpipe Tobacco Smoking and Associated Risk Factors among Bangladeshi University Students: An Exploratory Pilot Study,INT J MENT HEALTH AD,Int.

Identity Process Theory suggests that such a change in circumstances can threaten the child's identity, which triggers coping strategies and impacts on the individual's self-concept during both childhood and adulthood. This study undertook an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted with five adults who boarded as children. The focus was on exploring participants' beliefs in terms of how the boarding experience affected their sense of self. Emerging themes relate to the (i) coping strategies used by participants during childhood, such as amnesia, compartmentalising, compliance and acceptance, and (ii) long-term effects of boarding on identity, self-concept and intimate relationships. Findings also highlight the interplay of factors such as privilege and social class, which were reported as motives for participants' parents choosing boarding for their children.

The present study used the random intercepts cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) to examine both between-person and within-person associations between peer victimization and depressive symptoms among Chinese children and adolescents. Participants were 1205 Chinese students (M-age = 11.27 years; ranged from 9 to 15 years; SD = 1.75; 55% boys) who completed four surveys (Time 1 to Time 4) between 2017 and 2019 on demographics, peer victimization, and depressive symptoms. At the between-person level, peer victimization was positively associated with depressive symptoms. Controlling for between-person effects, RI-CLPM suggested positive within-person effects from peer victimization to depressive symptoms across adjacent waves. The model also suggested a positive within-person effect from Time 2 depressive symptoms to Time 3 peer victimization. The multi-group analysis showed that these effects did not differ by gender, age, or subjective socioeconomic status.
