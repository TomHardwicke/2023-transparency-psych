This folder contains the data created during this study. 

The prepare-sample folder contains data related to the preparation of the lists of articles.

The raw data folder contains the raw data generated when information was extracted from articles.

The primary data folder contains the data after the raw data underwent some initial preprocessing (documented in "analysis.Qmd").

The processed data folder contains the data after coding disagreements were resolved â€” this is the most mature version of the dataset that we recommended using for reanalyses. The raw and primary versions transparently document the different stages of the data.
